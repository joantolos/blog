The Internet is forever. I am going to use an example of the comedy industry to illustrate the point of this post, but it can be extrapolated to any aspect of life. Comedy has been always a risky business in the sense of offending people and going "over the line", it is actually part of the skill, to know when to push and when to pull back. If we take a look at old comedy movies or acts, we are going to see and hear stuff that sounds really offensive to our modern eyes. We are going to decide if it's funny enough so we can overcome the offence, ignore it and have a good time with it, or if we want to just change the channel. That threshold is going to be different for everyone and that is basically the deal with comedy. It shouldn't be more than that... you like it, found it funny, does not hurt your feelings to much? Enjoy. Is it going to far? Well, do not consume that entertainer anymore and things will sort out themselves. Good entertainers will thrive and bad ones will have to change their material and adapt to please the audience.

{{< url-link "Kevin Hart" "https://twitter.com/KevinHart4real" >}} is a comedian that also appears in a lot of movies so you probably know him. {{< url-link "Long story short" "https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/oscars/8492982/kevin-hart-oscar-hosting-controversy-timeline" >}}, he was supposed to host the Oscar's ceremony on 2019 but finally backed up because of a controversy regarding some tweets and comments that he did as jokes several years ago. The jokes were mostly insensitive with the gay and LGTB community.

His professional career was affected for a series of jokes and comments that he made years ago. Hosting (or not) the Oscar's ceremony is a big deal for an actor. He may win or loose contracts as a consequence. Now, this may be right or wrong, that's for each one to decide.

Public pressure and controversy put a pause on his career but there are a lot of other cases where is not a pause but practically an end. They call that {{< url-link "cancel culture" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture">}}.

# Cancel culture

Times change. Joking about gender, race, sex and other controversial topics, has been with us since always. The jokes change and become more sophisticated and adjusted to our times. If I think to some of the jokes my father was laughing some time ago, I find them inappropriate and probably my son will find inappropriate some stuff that I am laughing at right now. The main difference here, is the presence of Internet and social networking.

I did some stupid stuff when I was a teenager or even in my twenties. I mean, really embarrassing childish behaviour if I look at it from today’s point of view. Of course, now I am wiser (I hope) and less stupid but at the time, it seemed “right”. The difference is, back then, I didn’t have social networks to publicity my stupidity.

Me and my buddies, we didn’t have Internet and we were real jerks sometimes. The neighbourhood was tough and did whatever trying to figure out who we are and where it’s our place in the world.
That’s what we should let teenager and young people do. Let them make mistakes and embarras themselves awfully until (with luck) they find their own path. But this does not work if one or two missed steps on that path are “non returning mistakes”.

Then we can not grow and without growing we end up as half-child adults or just simply children, to be honest, no matter the age.

# Be curious, not judgemental

{{< img-post path="/img/road/" file="lasso.gif" alt="Ted Lasso rules" type="center" >}}

I recently came upon this quote by Walt Whitman, thanks to the TV Show {{< url-link "Ted Lasso" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410/" >}} by Apple TV (really good show if you want to take a look). I remember reading about it on {{< url-link "Leaves of Grass" "https://www.amazon.es/dp/1657675114/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_72Z7Fb328QAQ6" >}} but I am not sure. Anyway, what it means is that it is more profitable to ask questions and show interest than make a judgement call. If someone does something you don't like, the proper response (according to Whitman), is try to figure out the motives and reasons why people do what they do.

It doesn’t change behaviour, what it’s wrong is wrong and what is right is right but exposes a reason, a cause, some context. And context is important.

Being curious you can learn about the others and so, improve. Being judgemental you don't move from the starting point, even if you are right, so what? You keep stalled on your position, and not moving forward. It is just a very impractical position.

# What should we do about cancel culture

I don’t have an answer and I don’t even have a fully formed opinion. I guess It depends on the case and the circumstances. I just want to remind that it is wise to take a look at your own behaviour and flaws before judging other people.

Take a moment to consider how many stupid things you did in the past. Now image each and one of those things thrown at your face every time you go to a job interview, meet a new person or your in laws.

I guess this is just a call to reason. We have to be accountable of our own behaviour of course, and pay the price of our mistakes. But once the price is payed, we have to be able to move on and let go. Somehow, there has to be a way.
