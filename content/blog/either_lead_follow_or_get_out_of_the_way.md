_Lead, follow or get out of the way_ is a phrase widely used, specially on military context. It's attributed to several people: Thomas Paine (American political activist, philosopher), general Patton or even leaders of civil industries. I want to talk about it in the context of a software creation team.

## Committed or involved

It is often used on the agile community a reference to {{< url-link "the business fable of the chicken and the pig" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig" >}}, sometimes represented with a cartoon like:

{{< img-post path="/img/leadFollow/" file="chickenPig.png" alt="Chicken and pig" type="center" >}}

You have probably seen that before, the final goal is to point out the difference between commitment and involvement. The pig has stake in the game, it's literally leaving his skin on the project. The main different is what happens when the project fails... the pig is out of meat but the chicken can go lay eggs somewhere else. There is no right or wrong way actually, both ways produce results.

You can choose to just be involved and follow what the team decides and play along, that is ok. You can take more ownership, more accountability, put your neck on the line and take a bigger risk, that is ok too. Of course, the stakes are higher... if you choose to follow, the reward is not going to be as intense as if you take ownership.

The problem lays when the members of the same team feel different between them and some of them are committed and some others are just involved. The committed ones expect more from the involved and the involved resent the pressure and stress that receive from others. Doing iterations and corrections, the team can reach a delicate dynamic that can work. But this equilibrium is very fragile and when the team is temporary unbalance from some reason (vacations, sick days...), the productivity of the team suffers a lot.

The perfect scenario is when all members of the team are either committed or involved. So, the easier solution would be to observe all team members and see which tendency wins. Then, try to nudge the other ones to this winning tendency. If the team has ten members and seven of then are committed, you should try to convince the other three to be committed as well, and the other way around.

What makes a person be committed or involved depends on many factors. It depends on the way you look at your career, what your next steps should be, if this is just a temporary job for you, personal reasons, etc. It also depends on your relationship with your co workers and if that relationship allows you to feel optimistic or pessimistic about the project.

## Optimism, pessimism and cynicism

Optimism is the hopefulness and confidence about the future or the success of something while pessimism is the tendency to see the worst aspect of things or believe that the worst will happen.

There was a point in time where it made sense to be pessimistic. The pessimist of the tribe thought that every single bush hide a potential dangerous lion. That one survived and the other didn't. That is why is so embedded into us, it was a very useful trait for years and years of evolution.

Luckily for us, we are not at the savanna anymore and lions are reduced to cat pets wondering around the house. That kind of fear has been in our corner for ages, having our back, and now it starts to be the time to wave it goodbye.

At the work place, it is suitable to be an _informed optimism_. That means, base your decisions on knowledge and data but be optimistic enough to be able to _take controlled risks_. Otherwise, it is literally impossible to move forward.

When you get out of bed in the morning, every single step is a risk because you can slip and fall. But we don't keep still, we do it anyway because we rely on our **informed optimism** that we are not going to fall just by going to the bathroom.

And sometimes we do fall, mistakes happen and errors are made. But we fashion our home so it is not extremely dangerous to go from the bedroom to the bathroom, it is a **controlled risk**. In the same way, we are a little bit extra cautious on the kitchen because we know there is fire and knifes around. Or we concentrate a little bit more if we have to climb on a chair to reach the top cabinet.

We base our optimism in data and we take controlled risks.

You can be more or less conservative deciding what it is controlled risk and what is not. You can set the bar higher or lower, but by all means, take risks. If you don't take risks, you are not going to move forward, you are going to remain still, which means that your competitors are going to look at you on the rear view mirror.

There is a worst option than remaining still which is actually going backwards (or extremely slow which is virtually the same thing). {{< url-link "Cynicism" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(contemporary)" >}} is an attitude characterised by a general lack of faith or hope in people motivated by ambition, desire, goals, and opinions that a cynic perceives as vain, unobtainable, or ultimately meaningless and therefore deserving of ridicule or admonishment.

A cynic is going to point out problems to any endeavour but not going to propose any actual solution. It does not play the game and it doesn't let others play. That makes the team go backwards.

Be extremely optimist and you will crash at the first bump of the road, be extremely pessimist and you will remain still, frozen by fear, be a cynic and you will have a miserable time poking holes at the ship while others are trying to thrive.

Find the proper balance between optimism and pessimism and aim for the stars.

## My personal take

Back to the post title: either lead, follow or get out of the way. Don't be a cynic trying to hack a fourth option, there is none.

I personally prefer to be committed to the project, it's just more fun and fulfilling to me. Also, the stakes are higher so the rewards are usually more attractive. I put my neck on the line and sometimes, when I fail or make a mistake, the consequences are severe. I can live with that.

But this is my personal way of doing things in general... I try to be passionate about what I do in more or less everything that I do. When I am playing with my children, I try to get involved in the fiction. If I am drawing a picture with them, I try to do it well (and I am awful at drawing so it takes a lot). If I tell them a bed time story, I try to come up with a good one. If I sing a lullaby I try to be more or less in tune...

My point is, I can't do anything about the past and who knows what the future holds. So, as far as I am concern, right now is the only time I have to enjoy. No task is too big or too small for me, I put the same amount of passion and dedication for everything I do at work.
