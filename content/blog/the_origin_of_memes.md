The term _meme_ was originally created by Richard Dawkins on his 1976 book: {{< url-link "The Selfish Gene." "https://amzn.to/2VxDiX0" >}} This book has become a classic on the science circles and builds up into the concept of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin. The idea behind the book is to explain the importance and the big role that the gene plays on evolution. For the purpose of this post, let's just summarise that the gene is a unit of replication capable of copy genetic information from generation to generation.

In one of the last chapters, Dawkins introduces the term _meme_ as the _new replicants_ meaning that in our modern society, the gene is no longer the only actor involved on evolution, nor the only unit capable of replicate through generations. Culture then, is analog to biology in the sense that it evolves and transmit from generation to generation.

Then he establishes a series of examples of _cultural mutations_ like the song of birds. Birds repeat the mating songs over and over so they are "learned" by the younger generations so they can replicate the song and mate. But on this repetition, mistakes are made, and the young bird starts repeating a slightly different version of the song, couple of notes different here and there. This are actually mutations in a strict sense. Some of this mutations stick and some others are just eliminated, and that is how the mating song "evolves". Just as the gene mutation, the song "improves" with time and becomes better. Bad mutations are eliminated and good mutations prosper. What is a bad mutation in the context of a bird song? Well, I don't know... maybe some cacophony... ask the birds.

For humans, the obvious example of cultural mutation is language. Language evolves, some mutations stick and some other don't... you don't have to go far back to see how your own language has evolved. I am sure I talk way different than my grandparents did, and that is an insignificant length of time. Other not so obvious examples are clothing, diet, ceremonies, customs, art, architecture, technology... in short... culture.

Dawkins extends the Darwinian theory of evolution from genes to culture. If we understand the gene as the replicating entity or imitation unit, the mimic, if you will, then... **_meme_**.

It is actually a reinterpretation of the word mimic and it also resembles "memory" which is appropriate, because we can think of a meme of a unit of "memory" replicating from mind to mind. From this definition we can think of memes as songs, fashion, ideas, etc... The same way the genes jump from generation to generation through the eggs and spermatozoids, the memes jump from head to head by a process of mimic.

## The cultural meme of God

Dawkins is also famous for being one of the big promoters of the new atheism. From wikipedia:

> The term New Atheism was coined by the journalist Gary Wolf in 2006 to describe the positions promoted by some atheists of the twenty-first century. This modern-day atheism is advanced by a group of thinkers and writers who advocate the view that superstition, religion and irrationalism should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticised, and challenged by rational argument wherever they exert undue influence, such as in government, education, and politics.

>New Atheism describes a period of time when atheistic, anti-religious, humanist, and antitheist talking points were highly visible in the media landscape. New Atheism often criticised what writers such as Richard Dawkins described as the indoctrination of children and the social harms caused by perpetuating ideologies founded on belief in the supernatural. At the time, critics of the movement deployed pejorative terms such as militant atheism and fundamentalist atheism to malign vocal atheists.

Being a firm atheist, Dawkins explains the idea or concept of God as one of the successful memes of human history. This idea brings stability and an answer to profound problems. It also suggest that the injustices of this world will be resolved in the next one. This big cultural meme serves as a _pillow to rest our troubled heads_.

## Problems of memes

Dawkins recognised differences between memes and genes. Memes don't have a high level of fidelity on replication. Human imagination and creativity keep changing them in a rate way higher that the genes are capable of.

Also, there is the problem of granularity. Taking as example the 9th Beethoven Symphony, what is actually the meme? The whole forty minutes? A single phrase? A note?. These are just a couple of problems with memes.

## From memes to Internet memes

This book was wrote on 1976, how do you go from this concept of meme to the modern Internet Memes? It wasn't until 1993 that Mike Godwin used the term in it's modern form on an article of the Wired magazine.

After that, first memes where sent by e-mail and instant messaging. The first ones, where suppose to mock this classic motivational posters, with the black background. That is why you may recognise this classic format of meme:

This type of mockery was very popular on the early internet:

{{< img-post path="/img/memes/" file="mockMeme.png" alt="Classic motivational poster" type="center" >}}

See how they copied the original intention, the typo etc...

After that, the social networks came along and the rest is history.

By the way, Richard Dawkins commented on 2003 about this new use of his term and he is ok with it, it seems natural to him and also has a list of distinctions and differences between his original idea of meme and the modern concept of Internet meme.
