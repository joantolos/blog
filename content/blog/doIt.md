From time to time somebody ask me *_how do I do it_* meaning, how I manage to do all the things that I do besides the normal activity of work and family.

Here the things that I do on my spare time:

* Read books
* Write blog posts
* Play guitar
* Work on my pet project
* Exercise

So people ask me, how I _have_ the time to do that things. As if somebody can _have_ time. Time is something you make, not something you have. I have adopted several habits to make time for things that I like in a kind of subconscious manner. I have been including changes in my life and new routines inadvertently, little by little. Only when I get asked about it, I can recapitulate and figure out all the little things.

# Use productivity apps

I am writing this post (really the first draft) in an {{< url-link "Evernote" "https://evernote.com" >}} note that later will post on the repository for the blog code. I use it for both work related and personal stuff notes. Evernote just changed my life, I am not sure that I could work comfortably without it.

I also use {{< url-link "Wunderlist" "https://www.wunderlist.com" >}} to keep TO-DO lists synchronised with my wife like groceries shopping list. That way, if any of us notice that we need to shop something, just add it to the list and the other one can see it in real time. Sometimes I am at the supermarket ticking items on the list adding them to my shopping cart and my wife is at home looking at the refrigerator and adding "mayonnaise" to the list. I can see it appear right away.

I use {{< url-link "Coach Me" "https://www.coach.me" >}} which is a little app that the Twitter team started a long time a go and I feel it's not having as much success as expected because it has not improved or change for a long time. But I like it and I use it.
It's about goals and habits tracking so for example, if you want to develop the habit for call your mom for often, you just add the habit "Call mom and dad" and you tick every time you do it. The app prompts you with suggestions and greetings when you reach certain milestones. It’s my little motivation app. It also has social-media capabilities like you can follow other people with the same goals and motivate each other. I don’t know any person that it uses it, so I don’t follow anybody and nobody follows me. I just like to feel ‘the power of click’ and mark a task as ‘done’ which is super rewarding.

Use a social media aggregator like {{< url-link "Buffer" "https://buffer.com" >}} to post on several places at the same time. I only use it for Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn which are the social media places that I use. It is a powerful tool that can be use by a community manager with lots of options, I just use it for replication, nothing fancy.

If you google "productivity apps", I am sure you can find lots of options that can fit your needs.

# Listen to podcasts

I have loved radio forever. Since I was a child, I remember taping my favourites shows (mostly comedy) and enjoying them on my walkman on the way to high school. This operation now is super easy with podcasts. Is radio on demand it has all the benefits from radio and none of the inconvenience.

Is in fact, better than regular radio because no big network has to be behind the program to succeed.

I learn a lot from podcast, and I listen to them any opportunity I have. These are the podcasts that I’m listening right now:

{{< img-post path="/img/doIt/" file="podcast.png" alt="Podcast">}}

As you can see, mostly comedy and science. These podcast episodes sometimes leads me to a book, a record, a movie... is just an amazing source of references.

Some people I discovered listening to podcast include author Lawrence Krauss, author Johann Hari, musician Kamasi Washington... and a big etc. Those are just from the top of my head. It is usual for me to stop the playback to make a note about some reference that I liked.

Listening to podcast is a wonderful way of make the best of your time.

# Configure your ebooks app

When I buy a new book, I also buy the ebook and put it on my phone. It is not so comfortable to read on the phone screen but I just use it on the spare time during commute, waiting on an unexpected line, etc. Think of it like this... those times where you look at Facebook or Twitter on your phone, I have changed them for reading my current book. Then when I go home, just update my physical book and go on reading from there.

Think of how many times you check Facebook (or any other social media) a day. Now think what would happen if you invested all that time on reading an interesting book.

# Enjoy your hobby

It is important to do some activity that it just brings you joy with any other pretension. In my case, is playing guitar and making music. I don't do it for likes, I don't want to sell a golden record, I do it for it's intrinsic value. I record songs and put them on {{< url-link "SoundCloud" "https://soundcloud.com/joantolos" >}} and {{< url-link "YouTube" "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1fa6SHZiEj3Kuj7L6YJcTw" >}} but the only playbacks are mine (and maybe my father). That's ok, I put them there just to be able to hear them anywhere, anytime.

Consider a child playing. If you are able to observe how he or she plays without him or her noticing, you will see how the child looses on the game. It doesn't matter if the game has any sense... an astronaut can be flying through the space driving a car shaped like a monkey. Nothing else matters than the game itself. The child is not taking into account if the role game is accurate, if it is doing it "right", if the batteries run out or anything. It is completely engaged with the game.

Cultivate that activity that makes you feel like a child again. If you like to run, forget about the extrinsic rewards and enjoy the experience. Whatever is is, drawing, build models... don't do it for the reward, the experience is the reward itself. Look at this fantastic cartoon by {{< url-link "Paco Sordo" "http://www.facebook.com/pacosordoillustration" >}} that illustrates the point perfectly:

# Meditate

There is a lot of information on the Internet about how to do it and the benefits it carries. You can use apps or multiple options to start. It's easier than it sounds.

I do it on the bus while going to work. Granted, people look at you a little weird when see you seated with your eyes closed when you are clearly not sleeping, but I can live with that. Then I do it later again before going to sleep. It just works, clears your mind and makes you feel better on the long run. It is an activity that takes time to work and see the benefits, just give it a chance.

# Quit something

Of course.

Nothing is free. You have to renounce to something, that is just a fact. In my case, when my first child was born, after a few months I realised that I left following my soccer team. I had no idea anymore of who was playing, when was the next match or nothing. It came natural to me, I think that the left over activities in your life just appear as you need more time for other things.

By the way, I don't play video games anymore. Again, just naturally, I didn't realise when I stopped playing, it came naturally. I had a great time playing video games a long time ago. Today, it is not for me anymore, no trauma.

Just start doing what you (really) want to do, and the things that doesn't have place in your life anymore, will just leave.

# I screw up a lot

That is a fact (ask my wife if you don't believe me).
I forget things, sometimes mess up appointments and a long list... It is going to happen, just allow a little room to mess things up, and make your peace with it.
