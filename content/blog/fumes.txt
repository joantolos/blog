It is desirable to be physically healthy. When we are out of shape we suffer the consequences rapidly and we want to abandon that situation as soon as possible and regain our health.

We also see the benefits of being not only healthy but fit. The main difference between healthy and fit that I want to use for make the point of this post is:

**_When you are healthy, you are ok. When you are fit you are ready._**

Ready to tackle any possible eventuality (and eventualities are coming, that is for sure). Being ok is fine, is a starting point. Better than being bad of course, but we really want to be better than that. Not only ok, but ready.

# Example

Physical simile, car runs out of gas and you have to run or climb with weight. Solutions: healthy food and exercise. The point is not being super fit, unless you are a body model or something, that does not interest me at all.



Ok, so we can agree that being physically fit is a good investment on long term and that healthy food and exercise is **one** way to reach that goal. But what about mentally? How can we proper feed our brain? Can we exercise it?

What happens if a situation like the car example happens but at a mental level? An emergency, a big change in our life, a  tragedy of some sort... We can not handle it just the same. So nature, your body and society (culture) takes over and nasty consequences like stress, depression and anxiety appear. Because we are not ready, we are running on fumes, the stakes of the game are higher and we don’t know what to do.

That is something we want to avoid.

# Mental food

We feed our body through our mouths and we feed our brain with the rest of the senses. So you better watch out for what you see and what you listen mostly because those are the main sources of food for your brain.

You can read a comic, todays paper or Dostoievski. Don’t get me wrong I love comics but even then you can read the comic strip of a magazine or a cool graphic novel. Maybe you don’t want to be reading the classics of philosophy all day long but... how about a little? It is very important what you see (in this case, what you read) so give it a try. I like the stoics and some of my recurrent reads are Marco Aurelio and Seneca. Find your cup of tea, there is a lot already thought, explained and exposed and you can (you should) benefit from it.
Don’t be afraid of trying books about philosophy, ethics, religions... books that try to answer the fundamental questions of life. It may be overwhelming at the beginning but your brain wants to learn, it has curiosity hardwired so you will be fine with those topics really quick.

What else you can use your eyes for... of course: television (or streaming services probably). All right I have to admit... sometimes I love sitting in front of the TV and watch that silly reality show about those brothers that buy and sell houses... Is the most stupid thing but is rather pleasant.

And what about those guys that own a pawn shop and they encounter the most weird artifacts? Delightful.

What about online... that’s a good rabbit hole. You can spend the rest of your life looking just at videos of cats and probably never repeat one. Hell, here is one of Jowi, my cat.

I call it “fry my brain” and I do it sometimes. No problem at all.

But really... make these kind of shows the only thing you watch? Don’t you think that maybe you are missing something?

There are a lot of options if you want to feed your brain with something more healthy. You can watch documentaries if you like the TV. If you go more online, you can watch {{< url-link "actual lectures of classes from universities" "https://ocw-origin.odl.mit.edu" >}}

What about our ears, what we hear. PODCAST

# Mental training

So, we have an idea of our mental healthy food, but what about the mental exercises that we can do. At the end of the day, there has to be a way to train your brain. And I am not talking about those training games that can be entertaining of course, but with no increment of your mental capabilities whatsoever {{< url-link "(study)." "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308839928_Do_Brain-Training_Programs_Work" >}}

From wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_training

_Although there is strong evidence that aspects of brain structure remain "plastic" throughout life and that high levels of mental activity are associated with reduced risks of age-related dementia, scientific critics assert that support for the concept of "brain fitness" is limited.[2][3]The term is infrequently used in academic literature, but is commonly used in the context of self-help books and commercial products._

All right so don’t expect the ten brain exercises that boost your memory or weird brain exercises that makes you smarter kind of click bait. What I am proposing is most obvious than all of that and it is not a magic pill that will solve all your problems. It requires hard work (like everything).

So what are my suggestions?

#Write

It is alarming the amount of adults that can not write (study). Yes, they can write a few sentences, but not really. Ask them to fill a form with a complain for example or write about simple topic like “what is your favorite movie and why”. You will find incoherent phrases, un ended trains of thought and you will really struggle to understand what they mean by all these words.

And that is the point. When you write, you try to make a point so other people can read and figure out a little approximation of what you think. Our thoughts are abstract, we don’t really even understand completely how are they formed. When you write, you try to go from the abstract to the concrete and that takes a lot of work. Specially if it is a complicated thought.

Bear in mind that if you write as you talk, even if you talk well, you write bad. Most communication is non verbal (study) so when you talk, you make your point across mostly by gestures, tone and a million more factors other than the actual words coming out of your mouth. Those factors we lose if we try to write as we speak so the result is incoherent or difficult to understand. Just read a transcript of a trial or something like that. Is just unbearable.

#Think.

Of course. Do you want to be better at something? Well, practice is the key. Do it again and again. But what do I mean by “think”... just sit and think? Well, almost, but not quite (although there is nothing wrong with that).

Ask yourself questions, is the better way. Like playing chess, imagine several scenarios and how they develop and evolve in time, calculate the outcomes for all those different situations and go back when you hit a dead end.

* Why do you go to work?
* What is the purpose of your life?
* Are you happy with the way your life is going?
* Why you do what you do?
* Is there something you would like to change?
* If so, why?
* And on and on...

Those questions do not have a correct or incorrect answer, but they force you to think and reflect. And if you are constant enough you will develop practice and you will become better at thinking. As easy as that.

Then when a complex situation appears, you will be “fit” to tackle it.

You can go to a therapist.
Therapist are there not only for when you have some kind of problem.

Think of it like you would do with a personal trainer on your gim. It is actually the best way to start if you never have done physical exercise. The trainer guides you through the exercises, makes sure that you don’t hurt yourself and teaches you the technique in order to do it by yourself. Same thing with a therapist.

# Just roll with it.

Another way to go both for physical training and mental training is just go for it at the best of your abilities, no professional involve. You do your research, try some technique, fail, learn and try again.

I blew both my knees doing burpees (link to Wikipedia). I stopped on time, seek advice, recover and start again with a better technique and now my knees are
safer.

Same thing when learning how to think. Seek an author that you like, try his or her way of doing things and think, apply those teachings for a while and see how it goes. Maybe fail, change directions, correct the course and try again.

You do that forever, always learning, always improving, never remaining still. Because even if you think that you have everything figure it out, if you remain still with your core of believes intact, change will appear in your life and you will have to adapt and evolve again.

Take over.
Don’t be running on fumes. You have the most potent tool known and it comes “out of the box”, for free. Don’t waste your potential. Build a strong foundation so when things don’t go your way, you have a healthy reserve ready to help you.

If you take a look at my suggestions (read, write, think...) I am merely just saying: **use** your brain, be curious.

And now, to finish, here it is again: Jowi (my cat)
