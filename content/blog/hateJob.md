Every time I have to do some official paperwork like renew my id or passport - things like that - I wonder what kind of experience I am going to have. Recently I had to renew my id and the experience was the worse. I know we don't usually think on that terms when doing that kind of paperwork, but you have another human being in front of you, that is dealing with costumers face to face.

I want to explain two instances of experiences like that and then I would like to share some thoughts:

# Simple id renewal

This is a procedure that should be pretty direct and simple, we go through it several times in our lives, and it shouldn't be traumatic at all. After waiting a fair amount of time (although I had a proper appointment), I finally go to the assigned table where the woman in charge of the task was waiting. She proceeded to ask me the documents needed, I had to renew the id and the passport both at the same time and that would imply more work for her.

    _Sign this... put your finger there... give me that... sign again..._

She was reciting all the steps like a robot, making me wait without saying any polite formula like _just a second_ or _this will take a moment_. Talking out loud with their peers on other tables about personal stuff and completely ignoring the fact that she had an actual human being sitting in front of her. Suddenly I realise that she hadn't looked at me - at my eyes - in the whole encounter.

Then I proceed to force myself to look at her in the eye all the time to see if she looked at mine. You guest it. Not a single time she looked at me. We did the whole transaction without a single eye contact. She didn't even call me by my name (that had in front of her all the time on all the paperwork).

It took a fair amount of time because there were two transactions and my experience worsened moment by moment. I left the table feeling awful.
