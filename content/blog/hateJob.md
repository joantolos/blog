_“Between 2011 and 2012 the polling company Gallup conducted the most detailed study ever carried out of how people across the world feel about their work. They studied millions of workers across 142 countries. They found that 13 percent of people say they are **engaged** in their jobs, which means they are 'enthusiastic about, and committed to their work and contribute to their organisation in a positive manner.'
Against them, 63 percent say they are **not engaged**, which is defined as 'sleepwalking through their workday, putting time (but not energy or passion) into their work.'
And a further 24 percent are **actively disengaged.** They, Gallup explained, 'aren’t just unhappy at work; they're busy acting out their unhappiness. Every day, these workers undermine what their engaged co-workers accomplish... Actively disengaged employees are more or less out to damage their company.'

Are you **engaged**, **disengaged** or **actively disengaged** in your job?

I would like to explain two instances of experiences dealing with actively disengaged people at the work place.

# Simple id renewal

This is a procedure that should be pretty direct and simple, we go through it several times in our lives, and it shouldn't be traumatic at all. After waiting a fair amount of time (although I had a proper appointment), I finally go to the assigned table where the woman in charge of the task was waiting. She proceeded to ask me the documents needed.

  _Sign this... put your finger there... give me that... sign again..._

She was reciting all the steps like a robot, making me wait without saying any polite formula like _just a second_ or _this will take a moment_. Talking out loud with their peers complaining because somebody installed a new printer and they didn't know how to use it yet, completely ignoring the fact that she had an actual human being sitting in front of her. I swear it remember me the scene from {{< url-link "2001 A space odyssey" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9woRJ7-mD7Y" >}} with the monkeys and the monolith:

{{<img-post path="/img/hateJob/" file="monolith.gif" alt="The dawn of men" type="left">}}

Suddenly I realise that she hadn't looked at me - at my eyes - in the whole encounter. Then I proceed to force myself to look at her in the eye all the time to see if she looked at mine. You guest it. Not a single time she looked at me. We did the whole transaction without a single eye contact. She didn't even call me by my name (that had in front of her all the time on all the paperwork).

I left the table feeling awful.

# Registering the new born

When my first child was born, I had to go to the register to inscribe the new baby into the family. It is a fairly difficult procedure, even if the conditions are in your favour. But if your are from other country or you had kids with other partner before (things like that), the experience can be a nightmare.

The situation on Barcelona, where I live at the moment, is the following: there are more children born from immigrants that from city-born people. That is just a fact, no judgement whatsoever. The consequences are that the people working have to deal with persons that sometimes don't understand or speak the language well. I understand that makes their job more challenging. While I was waiting in line, I saw a man going from one line to another, filling forms and being completely lost. I also hear one of the
official telling confusing directions to him, and I can speak for that person intent, but I felt like he was trying to get rid of him just sending him to another line. I felt awful again.

When I finished my paperwork I approach the man and offered my help. I filled the forms with him, waited in line and helped him through the process. He had two previous children, was registering the third, had a previous one that died on delivery (you have to register them as well) and both him and his wife were from Morocco. Those are just circumstances that made the process a little bit more difficult. I helped him through it.

# Working conditions

I am not an expert, but I believe the officials working on that positions have a fair enough good job conditions. Of course, there are difficulties as on every other job, but I think they have to apply, there are limited places and it is difficult to get one. They choose that job, it was difficult to get and now they finally got it... to do what? To complain about a printer? To confuse a guy that struggles with the language?

I bet there are lots of people that would give anything to have a job like that. Guys with people skills that like helping others.

# Why do you hate your work?

You choose your job, you (and only you) are responsible for your career. I am tired to listen:

* My boss is an asshole
* The client does not know what it wants
* The company is unfair
* I am not accepted by my team

Everybody had a boss that was an asshole anytime on their life, is that your excuse? I will normally answer to complains like that with a battery of questions:

* What are you doing to improve in your job?
* Are you reading books about your skill?
* Are you taking any course? (hundreds of free courses on the Internet)
* Are you interested to learn how other companies do the job that you are doing?
* Do you participate in any community interested of your skills?

Notice that all the questions are about you, not about your boss, your company, or about that guy at the office that you don't get by with...

It's about time to stand by our own decisions. Embrace change if you have made a mistake (that you will). Don't be afraid of pivot your career path, we are allowed to discover what we want to do. Talk clear about what you think it does not work on your job, propose improvements, work hard on that improvements, look for data to support your changes... just care about what you do and do it honestly at the best of your abilities.

The rest will come.
