When dealing with a conflict at work, you want to reach a win-win situation where both parts are satisfied. Some other quick solutions, like just voting among the team, still leaves a winner and a loser even if the process has been “just” or at least consensual with all the team. This kind of situations, can grow resentment among the members of the team and can create a big price to pay in the future.

So, what is the best way to reach a win win situation? Let’s start with a quick definition, so we have to goal clear:

> A win–win strategy is a collaborative strategy and conflict resolution process that aims to accommodate all participants. (Wikipedia)

We want to satisfy both parties, in order to do that, I have found that the best way to do it is find a **common goal**, that is the key. In our kind of business (coding) it is usually easy to find that common goal: the project. The question is _what is best for the project?_

That way you switch the focus from the people to the “thing” (the project, the artifact, whatever it is that you are building that provides value to the user). People have egos, things don’t. So, no ego gets hurt when you have the best interest of the project in mind.

Emotions are wonderful, it is what makes us human but they mess everything. If you are trying to build something, emotions just get in the way. It is wrong to negate people’s emotions or asking them to ignore them, don’t do that. Let’s just make both parties agree that satisfying one’s opinion it is not the goal of the job, but to provide value to the user.

# Being right is useless

The worst conflicts get stuck into the absurd loop on who is right. But the real true is that it does not matter one bit who is right or who is wrong. I have accomplish nothing by being right. Think about it for a second... did you ever get a raise because you were right? Did you score a better job? Did you improve your relationship with whoever you were fighting?

So, you want to be right, or you want the job to get done?

The sooner you get this idea to the conflicting parties, the quicker they will reach a consensus. Just abandon the urge to be right. It is just a huge waste of time.

# An example

John Doe wants to add a new cool technology which is hip right now. Jane Doe thinks that the change is expensive and risky and we should stay how we are. Also, Jane does not like the new technology, it founds it difficult to understand. John argues that the learning curve is a bit high, true, but the benefits at the end are really worth it. It also reminds Jane that other time she was reluctant to add that other new technology and look how well it works now. Jane just don't like change, John argues. Jane is on the defensive now because the argument is personal: her way to deal with change has nothing to do with the decision... Also, she thinks that John always wants to add the new shiny stuff "just because".

The discussion goes on and on, I am sure you have live several alternative versions of this discussion (I remember real wars about which is the best GIT branching strategy). What they all have in common is that people are _**looking at each other**_ instead of _**looking in the same direction**_. It has become _**you against me**_ instead of _**us against the problem**_.

There isn't one bit on the discussion above where the project gets mentioned.

* What are the benefits of this new technology
* How much community is behind the new one vs the current one
* How will increase the value for the user
* How this value will become revenue
* How much hours involved on the migration
* How much hours involved on the learning
* What it's the cost of not migrating and keep it the same
* What are the savings that the migration will provide long term

All this questions talk about the thing, the project, not the people. It does not matter if you don't "like" the technology. It does not matter if you think that some coworker is reluctant to change. What does that have to do with the project?

Switch the focus from the people to the thing and it will get easier.
