As the world is facing the pandemic caused by this new Coronavirus strain, most of my colleges and myself are forced to work from home.
I want to share my experience working without leaving the house.

## Particular circumstances

I want to point out that this is not just "working from home", these are extreme circumstances.

In my case, the most defining one is the fact that the schools are closed. That means that my two kids (which are four and two) have to be with my wife and myself at home and due to their ages, we can not leave them alone. My wife has to work as well so, here we have our first extenuating circumstance: how to organise time so we can both work and attend our kids.
Not only attend them, we face the challenge of entertain them, teach them and make a good experience of it all. We don't want two little kids just wondering around the house not harming themselves... they have to learn, improve and grow healthy. So, each one of us has basically three goals:

- Do my job
- Enable my partner to do his/her job
- Provide a fun and healthy learning environment for our kids.

If we think about it, this is just a problem of handling limiting resources: the day has only so many hours, we are only two adults with three jobs to do.

We have put in place basic scheduling rules. As the kids are still little, they need to keep strict schedules in order for their little bodies to work well. They cannot deal with stress and physical tiresome as we do so we need to respect their meal and sleeping time. Everything revolves around that.

There are five milestones that we need to keep at all cost:

- Waking up hour (breakfast)
- Lunch time
- Nap time
- Dinner time
- Bed time

As long as we keep those five milestones, everything is going smooth. Kids respond very well to routines so we had that clear.

No meeting, no other task in our calendar could interfere with these five events. So every night after putting the kids to sleep, my wife and I organise the next day. If any one of us has an important meeting on lunch time, the other one would take care of that and then later compensate elsewhere. We are becoming masters of scheduling, we are working as a team.

We have included new little routines that the kids love like this calendar-thingy toy that they can update every day:

As far as work hours go, my wife and I divide the time and try to spend the same amount of hours working every day which are less than normal. But, in my case, those hours have been a lot more productive than before because now I have a lot more time to **think** about what I have to code. That way when I have a couple of hours in front of the laptop, I can go straight to the code because I have already run all permutations in my head for a long time and have a clear vision of what needs to be done.

I am also using nights and weekends to recover possible hours that I am loosing during the week. What really pays off, more that the "extra" weekend hours, is all the time that I spend **before** I start typing. That little mental exercise saves me countless hours. I really want to include this on my normal routines, if I manage to do the same thing on "normal office days", my productivity will increase a lot.

## Achievements

We want to see this situation as an opportunity. We are very aware of what we **can not** do during this lock down, but let's consider _what we can now do that we couldn't before_. Then let's try and use that in our favour.

* My four year's old, is no biting his nails anymore. Now that we have time with him, we put a strategy in place to convince him to stop doing it and against any guess, he has done it! We are very happy for him.
* My two year's old is now sleeping on her own bed instead of the bassinet besides our bed. There is never a good time to do this kind of stuff. Well... these days look like the perfect time.
* My four year's old is no longer using diapers for sleep time. Again, never a good time to do this, another milestone completed.
* My two year's old used to yell all the time to gain attention and now... well, she yells a bit less... what are you going to do, she is only two.
* The relationship with my wife has hugely improved. Now that we are together all day, we can work in improve little things we don't like from each other.
* We only leave the house to buy groceries, so we do it once every two weeks. Thanks to that we have figure out a different way to distribute our shopping list and taking a couple of looks... we can save about 150 euros each month just shopping in this new way. We plan to continue shopping like this when this lock down ends.
* I have learned and recorded three new songs with the guitar (two of them also bass guitar).
* I have a whole new collection of games and activities to do with my kids. I plan to keep doing them once this is over.

Everyone of these tasks has required a huge amount of work. Try to convince a four year's old to stop bitting his nails... But what we are suppose to do... seat around and complain about all the things we can't do? Well, we can do that or use our time to improve and enjoy. It has not been easy, at all.

## Mindfulness and meditation

What a clear example of mindfulness the fact that you can not touch your face. It has become very important what you do with your hands: _What have I touched today? Did I scratch my face after opening the door?_

You probably have seen this video:

> _The chief health officer for Santa Clara County, California, Dr. Sara Cody, licks her finger to turn a page during a coronavirus press conference. Her advice for the public: "Start working on not touching your face."_

She is not stupid, not at all. I mean, it is funny and all but she simply doesn’t have any idea of what her hands are doing, there are on autopilot. Like 90% of our body.
Can you imagine having to remember breathing? We couldn't make a single day.

Mindfulness and meditation helps you with that. You are more aware of your automatic behaviour so you can take over easily.

## Pandemic learning opportunity

These days we are starting all conversations with: _how are you, everyone healthy?_ All the sudden, we have become adults.

It is clear that the world will be different from now on but I want to consider the individual learning opportunities that we have now that we can not leave the house. I read a lot of people on Twitter and other social networks really struggling with the fact that their usual routines have been abruptly changed. You can no longer walk your dog for a couple of hours, go jogging or whatever you used to do... that should bother you, of course, but it shouldn't ruin your life.

Who would you be on the most stressful day of your life? You would only have the mind that you have built for yourself and the skills that you have acquired. That is who you are. Commodities and our easy way of life are only layers that can’t cover who we really are.
Isolation just strips all those layers away, leaving you alone with yourself.

You are not your job, you are not your streaming playlist, your jogging routines nor your walks on the beach. You are what's left when everything is gone.

Do you like that person? If not, don't wait to the next pandemic to change that.
