The outcome of this collaboration will be a blog post detailing everything that I have learned and explaining all the topics presented

- Equilibrium between ownership, delegation and accountability
- create trust: giving and delegating creates trust with each other. Respecting other peoples ideas. Positive reinforcement
- How not to favor one person more than the other... diplomacy "its a good idea but still we are going to go with..."
- Consensus decisions vs intelligent decisions.
- Go back to the business... as long as you are transparent
- Not doing secret management, the process is open we manage secrets
- Think about your manager in your past... their worst and their best
	- Not wanting to see what it's happening
