A few days ago, I was struggling at work with a simple implementation of sorting a couple of arrays. I was coding it in a language that I am not so good at: Javascript. I asked for help to one of my peers, we shared the pain for a little while and finally we got it.

Since it was such a simple "exercise looking" problem, I remember saying: _this looks like the typical exercise they ask you to solve on an interview, and both of us struggled for a while with such a simple problem. We suck._ And we had a few laughs.

Soon we are going to do interviews to add a new developer to the team and I thought that this very problem could be used on an interview, because it is simple enough but a little bit tricky. Moreover, why don't compile a collection of simple algorithmic problems like that?

The challenge is to extract this little problems from real day-to-day problems that we face on the team. So, the final collection would look like something that you could face working here.

## Hands on

I have translated the problem to some generic example using the Star Wars movies list, so no relation with the current project is revealed, but the problem is the same.

The code is right here: _{{< url-link "Star Wars movie order" "https://github.com/joantolos/kata-code-jam/tree/master/star-wars" >}}_

The idea is to keep an extra eye to the day to day work and do the same translation operation to other simple problems like that. The goal is, at the end, to have an interesting collection of simple algorithmic problems that more or less represents the day to day.

Involving all the members of the team, I also want to have several solutions on several languages of the same problem and help each other to improve the solutions.
