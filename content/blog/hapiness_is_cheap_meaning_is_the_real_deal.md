The headline on this post is not meant to be click bait. I really do think that happiness come cheap, but said it like that can sound mean. I don't intent to disrespect people that are actually not happy in their current lives. It just requires a little bit of explanation, so bear with me while I try to explore the concept of happiness from the point of view of the stoic philosophy.

When I say that happiness is cheap I don’t mean that it’s not important. There are a lot of very important things that are cheap... think about toilet paper and tell me that is not important, in fact, it's CRUCIAL, mostly when you run out of it.
So, happiness is important, granted, but what do I mean by cheap? I mean that happiness is everywhere on our daily life if you have the eye to find in and the right state of mind to enjoy it.

Let me expand a few examples... There is this a famous cartoon in Argentina called **Mafalda** by Quino.

{{< img-post path="/img/happiness/" file="mafalda.png" alt="Logo" type="center" >}}

In one of them Mafalda says that happiness is a bowl of french fries. Wait a minute, that must be wrong right? Well... think about it. What about a nice bowl of fries ready in front of the TV with your best friends around gathered to see the final match of your favourite team? That can be happiness for some people. That is not a big deal, is pretty common, and fries are definitely cheap.

I asked a long time ago to a friend of mine, what was happiness to him and he answered me one of the best answers that I've ever got. He stare at nothing for a moment and said "Happiness is when you really really have to go pee, and finally... you go". That is a brilliant answer and it's kind of right isn't it? Don't you feel really happy for a little moment there?

The next time that you are really thirsty, but really... like after doing intense exercise or in a hot summer day. Don't just grab the water and swallow like nothing. Grab the glass and look at it, just for a couple seconds. Think about the feeling in your body, the excruciating thirst that you are feeling and look at the solution right in front of you, that nice glass of cold water... That first gulp is happiness. It doesn't get any cheaper than that.

These three examples are ocurrences of day to day happiness that we can experience several times a day. But you have to be ready to be able to notice them, you have to be in peace with yourself so you can absorb this kind of things.

Happiness is like a soap bubble. You know those people sometimes at parks that make those giant bubbles with big Hula Hoops circles or wands? The bubble comes up in the air, it grows a little, it travels through the air for everyone to enjoy, you look at it, see your reflexion, see the pretty colours, smile and then slowly but surely, the bubble goes irredeemably to the ground. You don't get mad at the soap stain on the floor screaming _"you were suppose to make me happy forever!"_ That wouldn't make any sense, nobody does that.

But we do that sometimes with other things in our life that are supposed to make us happy. We are angry when specially happy periods of life ends, when cicles end. Why that sensation should last forever? That is not how happiness works. Happiness is like a a bubble... You should be able to grab while it last, enjoy it as much as you can and then be able to just let go.

Can’t spend your life making bubbles, that is a recipe for disaster, frustration and stress. That moments of happiness come, and you have to be on a right state of mind to be able to enjoy them. Enjoy them and let them go... don't hung up on the sensation because you can end up on a hamster wheel, running without an end.

What is the right state of mind then? How can I be prepared to embrace the bubbles when they come? Well, the stoics had something to say about that.

If you based your life on having more and more things... a nice car, a house, an even nicer car, a bigger house, then a boat… you are literally on the hamster wheel. This is called in philosophy: **the hedonist tread mill.** Your life becomes a game of “piggy in the middle”...

{{< img-post path="/img/happiness/" file="pig.png" alt="Logo" type="center" >}}

Bullies do that on school... they grab you your backpack or your snack and say to you... "come, grab it". And when you are there, they throw it to another bully. And so on... you are in the middle running to grab your thing and other people are keeping it from you.

That is incredible frustrating and annoying (that is why bullies do that). Running and running never getting what you want. Same thing with the bigger house, or the nicer car. You don’t want to be running on the tread mill forever... it’s a trap.

If you are overwhelmed by negative feelings, you are going to miss this moments of happiness. You are not going to be able to see the happiness of the bowl of french fries in front of you. You will eat them without a second thought and miss the opportunity. That is why one of the stoic goals is **tranquility**, more specifically what they called _ataraxia_.

> From wikipedia: Ataraxia, generally translated as "imperturbability", "equanimity", or "tranquility", is a Greek term first used in Ancient Greek philosophy by Pyrrho and subsequently Epicurus and the Stoics for a lucid state of robust equanimity characterised by ongoing freedom from distress and worry. In non-philosophical usage, the term was used to describe the ideal mental state for soldiers entering battle.

The term "a" in ataraxia stands by "absence of", it's a negation. Taraxia means (roughly) "disturbance, trouble", so ataraxia can be translated as well as "absence of disturbance or trouble". So, to achieve ataraxia, you have to start removing disturbance and trouble and what lays below is that feeling of tranquility.

For the stoics, ataraxia is not the ultimate goal of life. Instead, **a life of virtue according to nature is the goal of life.** However, according to the Stoics, living virtuously in accordance with nature would lead to ataraxia as a byproduct. When you remove all your negative emotions or passions, you achieve _apatheia_, according to the stoics:

> From Wikipedia: Apatheia describes freedom from the disturbance of negative emotions, not tranquility of the mind. However, apatheia is integral for a Stoic sage to reach the stage of ataraxia. Since the Stoic sage does not care about matters outside of himself and is not susceptible to emotion because of his state of apatheia, the Stoic sage would be unable to be disturbed by anything at all, meaning that he was in a stage of mental tranquility and thus was in the state of ataraxia.

Not to be confused by the modern english term "apathy" which carries negative connotations.

Happiness is a feeling “by default”. If you start removing negative feelings what lays below is happiness, it’s the default feeling of the child that all of us carry inside. Think of it as the peel of a fruit. The fruit is always there but the negative feelings and irrational thoughts you have are just hiding it from you. According to the stoics, you should live a life so those layers disappear and you can fully enjoy the fruit which was already there the whole time. The key to master this technique is not something you must do but something you must **stop doing.** You have to stop those irrational and negative thoughts.

I want to share an ultimate moment of happiness that I had in my life. I was in the park with my son which was three years old at the moment. It was getting late and the sky was clear so I could see the moon which was full moon at the time. I made him look at the sky and told him "Look! the moon is here already saying hi to us". My child asked me to carry him in order to touch the moon. “Grab me, grab me so I can touch it”... You can imagine the smile in my face and how much I enjoyed this moment.

If I had been stressed out of worried about something or having any other negative feelings I would had missed that. And I would never forgive me for that. Why do you even have children if not to make them touch the moon? It doesn’t get better than that.

And I grabbed him, of course, and we tried to touch the moon for a while.

So, we already stablished that you can find happiness almost everywhere if you are ready for it. What about a bigger goal in your life then. We don't want to be just jumping from happy moment to happy moment like stones in a river. We want our lives to have **meaning**. Be ready and don't miss a chance to be happy, of course, but establish some meaning to your life if you really want to feel accomplished.

An example of meaning is the iconic cartoon by Charles Shulz the creator of our beloved Peanuts cartoon. Charlie brown...

{{< img-post path="/img/happiness/" file="peanuts.png" alt="Logo" type="center" >}}

Charlie says to Lucy that we are put on this earth to make others happy. Lucy thinks a little and then screams in anger: "Well, then someone is not doing his job!". Meaning, she is not happy, so others should make her happy right?

{{< img-post path="/img/happiness/" file="peanuts2.png" alt="Logo" type="center" >}}

Joke aside... think a little about it. If everyone buys the premise: "We are here to make others happy", then YOU are going to be happy of course, if everyone does their part. That is some goal thought... you can seat back on your death bed and think... _I spent my life trying to make others happy_. Well, that may be a life well spent. Maybe. Maybe for you is not a big deal and that’s ok as well.

What do you want to remember on your dead bed? What do you want to be remembered for? What mark do you want to leave in the world when you are gone?

How do I answer those questions? Well I do have one answer but it’s way to personal. I'll share it with you over a nice meal or a drink. Come over, let’s talk.

Make your own answer, and notice that I said “make” and not “find”. There is nothing to find out there waiting for you. The universe doesn’t care about you. Oops, sorry I said it... but it’s true: you have to make your own life, create your own meaning and judge if you are on track or not.

You can spend your whole life being happy as a consequence of living a life that has meaning. Meaning is the goal, happiness is the byproduct.
