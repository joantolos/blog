Let’s explore the difference between repetition and iteration. When you repeat something, you are doing the same thing several times. When you iterate over something you are building over the previous outcome.
Let’s choose the proper tool (repetition or iteration) wisely.

# Agile example

One example that we may found familiar is the concept of agile development. The whole point is to deliver working software (remember: {{< url-link "working software over documentation" "https://agilemanifesto.org" >}}) so we can listen to the feedback early on. The smaller and faster is your feedback loop, the _better product_ you can build. Well, not necessary a better product but definitely the _better approximation of what the costumer actually wants_. Also you can reach market early and have that leverage over the competition. The benefits of iterate for that scenario are evident.

# Experience vs hours

The other example I wanted to explore on this post is the work experience and learning curve. I have been following several discussions on Twitter around the concept of seniority and what makes you a senior. Is it time? Is it a promotion?

The debate sometimes moves around years of experience, time on the field, etc. That makes some sort of sense because intuitively we thing experience is involved in some way. But what constitute real experience and how you can obtain more? If experience is a valuable asset, we may be interested of make it grow.

There is a huge difference between having ten years of experience and having one year repeated ten times.

The real experience comes from iteration, where you are building your skills up. If you repeat one set of skills over and over again, you just became more expert on that skill. But this is a short term game, because there always will be some other person more expert than you and also, younger and stronger people will come to eat your part of the pie. Then your expertise become more and more irrelevant as years go by. That is a winning ticket to become replaceable.

With real experience, on the other hand, you are not only expert on several aspects but also your set of skills are unique because are tied to your unique experience and career path. It is highly unlikely that other person can duplicate your exact same experience so you became more unique and so, more valuable and less replaceable.

# How to do it

There are several ways to favour iteration when building your career path. One obvious but sometimes radical solution is to switch jobs regularly. New team, new business rules, new procedures, new ways of doing the same thing... The first year on a new job you are learning at a very very high pace. Every new job is a new iteration where you use the outcome produced by the old job and apply it to the new, building a new set of skills and expanding the ones already there. But, switching jobs constantly also has it's bad side... you are not able to establish real long/mid term relationships with colleagues and some business have a hard learning curve. If you leave early, you have not learn enough about the business and miss the opportunity to push your boundaries.

Other more conservative option but maybe more realistic is trying to switch projects within the same company. That way you can work with more different people inside the boundaries of the same business. While you are trying to assimilate the business rules, you can learn from your colleagues.

The timeline goes something like this:

- On the first stage on a new job you are not profitable at all. You are just learning and being a sponge. Company invest in you, hoping to get their investment back. Usually it takes a year or so.
- On the second stage, the relationship becomes more symbiotic. You are adding value to the company and still learning, the relationship is profitable for the two parts. That could be the next couple of years.
- On the third stage, you have learnt everything relevant and career changing so the company is not profitable for you anymore. That is when the company starts to really enjoy the fruit of it's investment, you are providing value to them "for free". Usually that is the year number four or five. Time to leave.

I remember reading this somewhere, I don't know where, my apologies. Although the time spans were shorter (one year each stage), the idea was more or less that. If someone knows the source, please comment.

# Take over

When building your career, think iteration over repetition. There are certain skills where you have to repeat the same thing over and over again, that is unavoidable. I call them “the trained seal skills”.
If you want to learn a certain regular expression by heart, nothing will avoid you to just repeat and repeat until you learn it.
I you want to play piano, you will have to repeat the same tedious scales over and over again until the pathway is burned into your brain and the muscle memory finally sets in.
Just keep in mind that the skills you are obtaining through this repetition process are more fragile and mundane that the ones obtained by iteration process. Invest in them when it’s strictly necessary, you are not a trained seal. Human beings thrive with creativity, not pure repetition.
