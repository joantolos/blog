I have been looking at the new tool {{< url-link "GitHub copilot" "https://copilot.github.com" >}} (as everyone, I assume). I am on the waiting list to try it myself. I can't wait to start playing with it.

It is quite impressive not only when using it but learning a bit how it works. It is based on {{< url-link "GPT-3" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3" >}}, a language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. Of course, code is a subset of human generated text so it is only natural that this model that has had so much success, it is now used to generate code. Also, it is a reminder that code is nothing more (and nothing less), than a human writing activity. Yes, writing on a programming language instead of a natural language, but writing nonetheless. So, as a general tip, if you want to get better at programming, get better at writing!

Trivial tips a part, it looks like gets it right most of the time and it is able to predict correct code at first attempt 43% of the time, which it is pretty impressive. It looks like all those trips to StackOverflow are condemned. It is able to suggest correct code from comments, function names, tests... And it is not copied/pasted from the bast repository of open source code on GitHub, no. It is actually generated on the fly, fresh new code from the nothingness of the blank page.

It exists a big hype with this new tool and social networks and blogs have been firing up with comments and opinions about what this means to the programming craft.

# Is this technology going to render programmers obsolete?

I want to present two examples of technology advances that have rendered obsolete some jobs and crafts and let's explore them against GitHub copilot to see if we see similarities.

## Candle craftsmanship

Before electricity, the use on candles was the norm. Imagine lighting up an entire castle big room at night time for a post-battle feast. Hundreds and hundreds of candles were required. Candle craftsmanship was a big profession then, lots of revenue to be made then. Candles had to be made for every occasion... from the day to day peasant to the Queen's private chambers.
Obviously, the candler craftsman was not worried about the use of electricity making his job useless. He was worried about his competitors, about vendors, logistics, clients, etc... Not only that, the candler maker did not invent electricity to make his job easier.

No, electricity was not invented to "solve the problem of candles", electricity was just a big paradigm shift and everything was changed. The world was another one completely different.
At the end of the day, electricity came and candle makers disappeared (well, not disappeared but you get my point). It took a big paradigm shift to render that profession obsolete, and that shift did not came from that industry.

## The assembly line changed the world

Just at the bring of industrial revolution, lots of people were moving from country to cities seeking for an opportunity to make fortune. It may seem silly now but then horses in big cities became a problem. Well, horse manure specifically, creating a new problem known as {{< url-link "The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894" "https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Great-Horse-Manure-Crisis-of-1894/" >}} in London. You know how it goes... horses pulling carriages all along the city were causing a big stinky problem of manure everywhere.
Big brains were involved on solving that problem and some creative solutions were implemented with more or less success. But, at the end of the day, what solved the manure crisis? The car.

Again, a big paradigm shift rendered the problem obsolete. The manure problem was not solved, it was just not there anymore. And again, the car was not invented to solve the manure problem, it was a revolutionary new way of transportation that had that collateral effect: horses on big cities were not needed anymore. By the way, we are still grasping the consequences of the invention of the car, not only for the personal freedom that it provides but for the use of the {{< url-link "Assembly Line" "https://www.industryweek.com/innovation/process-improvement/article/21961364/ford-launched-the-modern-assembly-line-a-century-ago-and-changed-society#:~:text=Most%20critically%2C%20the%20assembly%20line,hours%20to%20just%2093%20minutes.&text=The%20assembly%20line%20also%20changed,repetitive%2C%20low%2Dskilled%20jobs." >}} and it's consequences.

In both cases, a big paradigm change was required and the problem was solved, or better said, rendered obsolete as an unintended consequence.

## The case of GitHub copilot

Is the GitHub copilot a similar example? I don't think so... it is created by the software industry to the software industry. It may have some unexpected consequences but I don't think is going to render the software programming profession obsolete.

It is a very nice tool that is going to make programmers life's easier... or at least different. Mostly for people that are just finishing their studies and will live with this kind of tools on their professional life from day one. The profession is going to change, no doubt about it. I believe is going to make it better. But at the end of the day is adding more cool tools to try to solve a problem: **building software.** These are helpers to make the software creation a better and easier profession, but it is not a paradigm change. It is more wood for the fire, which is always good news.

While the problem stills exists (lighting rooms at night, manure on the street or creating software), there is always going to be a need of professionals trying to solve that problem. It's when the problem does not exists anymore when professions disappear.

## The end of the problem

When programming is going to be obsolete? When there is no need anymore for creating software. Exactly as with the manure or the candle. Now, does that make sense? Is ever going to be a situation when there is no need for software?

Now we are entering the world of speculation so let's use our imagination... Let's think for a moment... what it's software? Software offers an interface for humans to interact with machines/data/networks etc. It goes something like:

    human -> software -> machine/data/network

It is literally an interface for humans to be able to communicate with machines. The day that the profession is over is when the situation is the following:

    human -> machine/data/network

Now, at that point is when programmers can start growing flowers or whatever because our profession is completely obsolete. That it is the paradigm change, the candles/electricity or manure/car situation.

## Is anyone creating an interface to connect humans with machines without software?

As it turns out... yes, there is. Take a look at what Neuralink is doing: https://neuralink.com This is their mission statement:

> Every day we’re building better tools for communicating with the brain. With the right team, the applications for this technology are limitless.

Take a look at this video of a pig with a chip implanted in his brain:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqbQuZOFvOQ" rel="FULL REVEAL! Elon Musk's Neuralink chip tested live in pig brains" target="blank"><img src="/img/copilot/pig.png" alt="FULL REVEAL! Elon Musk's Neuralink chip tested live in pig brains"></a>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

And this other one of a monkey playing Pong with his brain. Yes, with his brain, without peripherals, it moves the game with his mind, looking at the screen:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rXrGH52aoM" rel="Watch Elon Musk's Neuralink monkey play video games with his brain" target="blank"><img src="/img/copilot/monkey.png" alt="Watch Elon Musk's Neuralink monkey play video games with his brain"></a>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Now, is this the proper change of paradigm that can render our profession obsolete? Well, I don't know... someone has to create the software running on those chips maybe? I am not sure, but if that happens, it's going to be thanks to a revolution like that one. {{< url-link "GitHub copilot" "https://copilot.github.com" >}} does not look like this, actually a copilot always needs a pilot.

In any case, these are exciting times... our profession is growing and changing at a vertiginous rate, and that is exiting.

I can’t wait to see what this tool (or others similar) are going to be able to do once people start using them massively. Even if that means that I don’t have a job anymore, the spectacle will be awesome.

Grab a seat and enjoy the ride. As they say... {{< url-link "rock and roll is dead." "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw8_5OYKQNA" >}}
