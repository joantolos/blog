I had to develop a service with the **{{< url-link "Node.js" "https://nodejs.org/en/" >}}** Javascript runtime build. I use Test Driven Development on a daily basis and I always have to invest a little bit of time trying to provide the layout and infrastructure to make my life easy when working with tests.

I am not so fluent on Javascript so I had to compile information in order to have the proper tools to be able to code with TDD from day one.

# Mocha: Javascript test framework

# Nock: Mocking library for Node.js

# Istanbul: Javascript test coverage
