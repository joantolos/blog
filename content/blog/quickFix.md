Uber, Netflix, Spotify, fast food... As the song said... _"We want it all and we want it now."_ But, is it **now** always the **right time?** Can everything we need, be packed into a five minutes digested pills?

I recently stumbled upon an article explaining the techniques behind a good headline. These days it looks like social media interactions are starting to have a bad reputation, so it is hip to abandon them or hide over the most used catch phrase _"I just read articles."_ If you think that consuming articles (let's call them posts) on social media is freeing you from the social engineering that they apply to fulfil their business model, you are up to a big surprise.

There are techniques to make you click to those articles so you can see the advertisement they have for you. Of course, those are known as _click baits_. Everyone knows that, but take a moment to consider the word _bait_: They are _fishing_ for you. And we are biting, of course we are.

One of those tricks is start the headline with a number. I actually try it with a post of my own that was meant to be "Javascript Trifecta" but I renamed it to "6 tools to help you do TDD with NodeJS". And actually it got a better response than other similar posts that I've made. Some other examples:

> 3 Tips to find awesome inspiration

>The 4 areas I split my time into maximise success

>3 reasons why I embrace being a generalist

> 4 Simple tips I've used to craft my personal brand

> 3 Things that are wrong with DevOps today

> 3 Areas you have to make time for to find success

Those are real headlines I compiled from several social media feeds. And, I have to admit, they look attractive, worth a click.

But take a closer look to the content of the bait... three simple tricks, four steps to win, a fantastic easy (and of course) **quick** recipe for success. Why this headlines are so attractive? Because they appeal to an inner need to get things. A lot of them, quick an easy.

## Quick and easy

Look what you get if you Google _"quick and easy"_ and search for images:

Is it just me or the overall images look a lot like food? If you don't believe just try it: {{< url-link "let me google that for you" "http://lmgtfy.com/?t=i&q=quick+and+easy" >}}

Take a minute to consider... Google (so, all of us, the collective intelligence) answers with food, when you ask for _quick and easy._ What does it say about our society?

## Nothing worth having or accomplish comes quick and easy

If I take a look back and think about what I have accomplish in my life, nothing has been easy. My career, family, hobbies and entertainments; are enjoyable thanks to hours and hours of hard work and dedication.

I read books to improve in my programming skills so I can provide more value in my job place. I expend a lot of time thinking how I can improve my time with my family and make it one of more quality. Again, reading books, asking other people that know more than me, connecting with others and the community. Feeding from multiple sources of knowledge and wise advise. All of that is far from “quick and easy”. It requires dedication and discipline.

But the rewards are worth it. I have a job that fulfil my expectations, I go to work happy every morning. I enjoy a beautiful family and have a blast playing guitar and making music on my spare time. Expect that all of this will come easy, just because you follow some “magic steps” is kind of naive and childish.

## Success as a consequence

I think that success is a consequence, not a goal. If you aim purely for success, you are starting wrong. If you aim for excellence on the job, good team work, provide value, keep the client in mind, you will have success as a **consequence**. No doubt about it.

It’s like kids today who say they want to _become famous_. Not being a successful artist, a singer or whatever, but to be famous. Most of the artist I follow (mostly musicians) see the fame as something they have to deal with and not really enjoyable.

Those quick fixes, are aiming to a quick success, they are encouraging you to take a shortcut, as if there were any.
You want to eat a tasty meal, but you don’t want to take the time to buy the ingredients, learn the craft, cook the recipe... Instead you follow the _*3 steps to make the best salad*_ and you end up with some quick fix that will satisfy you for about twenty minutes. And then what? To the next fix you go.

You want to enjoy music but you won't follow an artist career from it's beginning and slowly increment your knowledge, socking on it's message until you understand the latest release. Instead of that, you go to Spotify and swallow the few single pills specially tailored “to your taste”.

And then what do you do with these extra value time that these marvellous advantages provide you? You use it to **consume** more. Ordering your delivery food gives you extra time to click on the next episode on Netflix. But soon this will be not enough and you will need another show to follow, and so it goes fix after fix after fix...

## Wake up: It's not gonna happen

There is no magic diet, no five minutes exercise routine will make you ripped, Santa does not exist and the earth is, in fact, round. Time for a reality check.
