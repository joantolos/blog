Fiction is very important in cognitive development. If you have young ones around you can easily notice that reading and sharing stories with young children helps them understand sounds, language, words, and even develop literacy skills. Reading or watching fiction with your children can also help them develop strong communication and social skills.

If you are able to observe children playing (specially if they don't notice you), you can find the perfect fiction structures that they create. Those fictions emerge completely spontaneous and natural and their ability to create and adapt is astonishing. The powerful imagination of a child, right?

{{< url-link "Play therapy" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_therapy" >}} refers to a range of methods of capitalising on children's natural urge to explore and harnessing it to meet and respond to the developmental and later also their mental health needs. It is based on the idea of _{{< url-link "Collective unconscious" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious" >}}_  coined by {{< url-link "Carl Jung" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung" >}}.

# The benefits of fiction

Children integrate fiction on their daily life without any effort. They jump between reality and fiction constantly, learning new concepts and behaviours among them. When children consume fiction in the form of stories, movies, tv shows etc... has a very profound affect on them. It is common for a child, after seeing a movie, to want to imitate whatever it is just saw. They are **inspired**. Which is what art is supposed to do.

Adults have a similar first reaction, but we are adults of course and we don't want to look like fools. We put clever comments on {{< url-link "IMDB" "https://www.imdb.com/" >}} or {{< url-link "goodreads" "https://www.goodreads.com" >}} instead, offering complicated critiques that make us look smart. And so, the inspiration is killed.

I am a fan of fiction and the inspiration it comes with it. I often let my imagination go after seeing or reading a good piece of fiction. I embrace the inspiration and motivation and some times, good outcomes come from that.

# The dangers of excessive fantasy

But beware! Be careful with embracing to constant fantasies that evades you from reality. **The brain does not differentiate between reality and fiction.** That is why we learn that criminals often have been fantasising a long time abut committing the crime before they actually act. For example, if you have a harmless thought about stealing a nice car... you think about the best way to do it, you see yourself driving it, you dwell on the feeling... Imagination is very powerful and again, your brain does not differentiate between reality and fiction. In your head, you already have stolen the car several times, so you **get used to the idea** and each time, the idea seems more and more doable.

We often see that behaviour from people who are unfaithful to their partners or even commit serious crimes. Entertaining excessive fantasies can be dangerous. Hence, the famous phrase _be careful what you wish for you might just get it_

My point is, fiction is a powerful tool used as inspiration and motivation, but letting yourself go into harmful fantasies is not doing you any favour.

# Suspension of disbelieve

In order to be able to enjoy fiction, you need a certain degree of suspension of disbelief.

> Suspension of disbelief, sometimes called willing suspension of disbelief, is the intentional avoidance of critical thinking or logic in examining something unreal or impossible in reality, such as a work of speculative fiction, in order to believe it **for the sake of enjoyment.** Aristotle first explored the idea of the concept in its relation to the principles of theatre; the audience ignores the unreality of fiction in order to experience catharsis

That is the phenomenon that allows us to enjoy movies about {{< url-link "cars that talk" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/" >}}, {{< url-link "real life dinosaurs" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/" >}} or {{< url-link "people in flying robot suits." "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/" >}}. If the work is well done, it's easy to achieve suspension of disbelieve and enjoy it. Otherwise it just look silly...

In movies for example, special effects are often used to help you get that state. Again, if it is well done, it really doesn't matter if what you see in the screen is accurate to reality or if the effect is a bit chunky. There are countless movies from the 80's with dubious special effects that are masterpieces.

It bothers me a bit when I am watching a movie with someone and the critique is... "oh! that monster looks fake". Well, yes... and Iron Man does not exist, you know? who cares is the monster looks fake? It is not the point of the movie, is it?

I see special effects like candy for the eye, they are fun to enjoy. But usually, movies that rely only on good special effects, do not go far. Think for example about the shark on {{< url-link "Jaws" "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/" >}}. Sometimes, the dummy looks silly. But you don't care, because the movie is so well done, that puts you on that state that allows you to disregard the fact that the shark is several times bigger than any shark on earth.

This is how big a white shark is compared to a human:

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="sharkReal.png" alt="Real shark size" type="center" >}}

And this was the shark from the movie:

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="sharkMovie.png" alt="Shark from Jaws size" type="center" >}}

If you think about it for a while, or if you pause at certain moments... it just looks silly:

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="jaws.png" alt="Impossible big shark" type="center" >}}

But again, it is so well done, that at this point on the movie, you don't really care. You are suspending disbelief completely.

# Technological movies

People get mad when a technological movie gets something horribly wrong... like when a "hacker" is typing nonsense to "access the Pentagon" or something like that. And it is annoying, I get it. But if the work is well done, a little bit of reality is enough. Good movies or tv shows, get enough right so they can introduce the fiction.

These are a few that I really like, from worse to better:

# Pirates of Silicon Valley

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="piratesOfSiliconValley.png" alt="Pirates of Silicon Valley movie poster" >}}

This is a TV Movie that it supposed to tell the story of the origins of Apple and Microsoft and their rivalry on the early years. Both Apple and Microsoft made statements that the picture did not reflect the reality one hundred percent, so we don't have to take the events as facts necessarily. For sure, the timelines are a little bit weird but I think it is a very good, humble movie. It captures the feeling of the information revolution on the early days of computing. The actors could be better, and the production is modest, but I really like it.

# Halt and catch fire

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="haltAndCatchFire.png" alt="Halt and catch fire poster" >}}

This modern TV show is also set on the early years of computers. It depicts a couple of characters that we can see happening in real life again and again: the business oriented mind and the engineering oriented mind working together. The Wozniak and the Jobs, if you like.
The events are fictional but again, I believe it captures the sentiment of those early years where everything looked possible and the truly potential of the field was envisioned only by a few people.

# Inside bill's brain

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="insideBillsBrain.png" alt="Halt and catch fire poster" >}}

This is a three part documentary that focus on Bill Gates. I found it interesting and also very inspirational. It goes from his youth to present time and tries to depict the personality and way of thinking of Bill Gates. I wasn't aware of the philanthropic work that _Bill and Melinda Gates foundation_ is doing and it was a very nice surprise.

# Silicon valley

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="siliconValley.png" alt="Silicon Valley poster" >}}

This is a very funny modern TV Show that explains the adventures of a bunch of guys trying to build their own company on Silicon Valley. One example of what I was mentioning early about the suspension of disbelief. This TV Show gets the reality of programming well enough just to get away with it, just to be able to tell the story and place some very funny jokes while doing it.
If you are a programmer you will see where the line is crossed and will think _"all right, from now on this is just not true"_ but you won't care. Because the fiction is well done, you are able to "let go" the mistakes and wrong assumptions.

# War games

{{< img-post path="/img/fiction/" file="warGames.png" alt="War Games movie poster" >}}

Excellent movie from 1983. It touches topics as relevant as machine learning and artificial intelligence and it is done in the background of the {{< url-link "Cold War" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" >}}, where everyone was afraid of everyone. It tells the story of a young hacker that connects by accident to a government super computer. The story is told with care, the machines that appear are all real and the little hacker tricks that the protagonist uses, are actually accurate.
I can't recommend this movie enough.
