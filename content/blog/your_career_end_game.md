This is a weird post. I am having a weird time. Not bad, I am more than good, but the last months I have been reflecting on my career and what the next steps should be. Granted, maybe the global pandemic helps a little to put things into perspective and favours these kinds of self reflecting thoughts.

What is the ultimate goal of my career? What is the end game? When I was a younger I had this almost "automatic" thought about how you should live your live. Got it from culture, education and who knows what else. What was the goal back then? Oh, yes, study, get a good job, figure out a stable way to live so finally you can... what?... **kick back and relax?** But the train of thought is like a stair... one accomplishment after another and you never run out of steps. Always following the next goal.

At this point I question myself... what should be the next step on my career? Switch jobs again and pursue another salary, another promotion? Or maybe start a company on my own? So I can finally what... **kick back and relax?**

Looks a little like a rat race to me, always looking for the cheese at the end of the maze.

What are the things that I value the most right now in my life? Obviously my kids. Ok, that is not a fair question... no hypothetical next step on my career is going to change, improve or worsen my kids. Let's rephrase the question then: What are the things that I value the most right now in my job?

If I valued the most... let's say the salary, then yes, a new job can improve that. If I valued the most the technology I used at my job, then yes, a new job can improve that. So yes, a job change can improve your reality if that new job aligns with your set of values and improve them.

What I value the most in my job, and in my life actually, is freedom. Freedom to me means being free from the calendar (in this context). I've always loved radio. I consumed radio programs like crazy since I was a kid. But I hated the schedule because some programs were live when I was at school or late at night... it was a nightmare trying to record those programs to listen to them later. Same thing happened with television. But then, someday I discovered Podcasts and that was freedom to me. All the sudden I was "free" from the radio. I didn't need to comply anymore to their schedules. I can listen to my programs at **my** convenience, I was free to listen at my rate.

That is to me the deal breaker: the freedom. I am working from home and I have flexible hours, but for real. If I get a call from school telling that my kid has a fever, I can close the laptop right there, get up from my chair and go pick him up. I can figure out later what to do with the work for the day and I make my own schedule. Most of the days I wake really early so I can have about two hours of work before everyone else is up. I love to see the sun rise from the window while coding. There is no one on the street, the air is fresh and for some reason, I code really well when I just wake up.

My wife works from home as well so we have lunch together everyday. She is right away in the next room, I stand from my desk every now and then and go there to say hi.

Ok, let's say that I have what I value the most. What about what I like? Do I have that? Let's see... I like to play guitar, read and computers. I should work towards the goal of being able to do what I like. But wait... I already can do that... I can grab my guitar any time, I can read until my eyes fall and I could code forever. Those activities are not specially expensive... I can have a guitar for less than 100 euros, books are not expensive (specially the old ones, the classics) and I can use a minuscule computer for coding. So, technically, I don't need a huge salary to be able to "do what I like". Of course, I won't tour the world with a 100 euros guitar, the latest of the best sellers books are not so cheap and if I want to code like a king I would like an expensive set up... but it's not really necessary to do what I enjoy.

Let's think about it in reverse... what would I miss the most if everything went away? Not the money, not the status but the freedom. Definitely. The free time to do things with my family and have lunch every day with my wife. Those things are so easy to take for granted.

What is the point of this rat race then. I have what I value the most and I can do what I like. So, I am already there? Should I stop? Should I keep pushing to the finish line or I am already there?

If I stop chasing the cheese at the end of the maze, isn't that complacency? Being complacent means to be pleased, especially with oneself or one's merits, advantages, situation, etc., often without awareness of some potential danger or defect. That is the point that worries me: miss some danger or opportunity because I am over complacent. I don't want to become irrelevant. Technology changes, jobs evolve and I am not getting any younger. The career is long and I plan to live a long time. I should keep my eyes open if I want to keep riding the wave.

This is a weird post... thank you for bearing with me if you got that far long. Have a wonderful new year.
