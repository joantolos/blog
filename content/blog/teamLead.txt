List of errors:
Grabbing coding duties. Les than half than before
Not having a proper knowledge transfer, coming from my developer bubble
Not taking ownership of mistakes and blaming others
Assuming everyone has the same virtues and failures than myself

List of corrections:
Assuming ownership of the mistakes
Creating clear goals and communicate them properly
Reward success and use as opportunity every failure (something has broken? Good)

# Marketing and politics

I have discover that there is a certain degree of marketing in the sense of "selling" what the team does. I don't have special interest in that, but I understand now that it may be an important part of the job.

# Take overs
People, not resources: working on satisfying the needs
I respect my tech lead even more now
I can be a better programmer
