I had the opportunity of take over my manager role for a brief period of time due to his parenting absence. I was doing it kind of informally when he was on vacation or had a sick day or something. This time it was for a longer and delimited period so we kind of "formalised" the whole thing.

I have to say, this time, I was really happy coding and had a very nice plan for the year (this role change was happening on January) and I didn't take the new responsibility with a lot of enthusiasm. But my manager has always been super nice to me and never said no when I was asking for favours, so of course I was going to do it as well as I could.

# List of errors:

Now, overall, the feedback from my coworkers has been good now that the period is over. But I have my own critique and I have compiled a list of errors that I feel are important. I had the opportunity to learn from these mistakes.

### Grabbing coding duties

I was used to assume a lot of coding work every sprint, that was my role. When acting as manager, even I adjusted the amount of work by a little less than a half of what I normally would do, I barely made it the first sprint. So, first lesson learned: when working on a management position, my time and capacity for regular coding was reduce by more than a half.

After struggling (a lot) on the first sprint, I finally found a safe and simple way to contribute with simple coding tasks to the team. I would grab tasks from the next sprints.

I don't know if this is very agile or not, but we keep a draft of what the next sprint would be like. Nothing committed, just like a "wish list", kind of _if we deliver everything for the actual sprint, we would like to do those other things on the next_. The product owner takes a look at this "next sprint" so he or she can adjust priorities and be in contact of what is the team expecting to do next. It establishes an on going conversation of "what's next". Well, it works for us.

I just started grabbing tasks from the next sprint. That way, if I didn't make it because of my other tasks as a manager, the current sprint was not compromised. Once I started to do that, I felt really relieve and actually I think that I contributed a lot more to the team.

### Not having a proper knowledge transfer

The circumstances were weird: it was someone else supposed to do this acting manager role. He was doing a proper knowledge transfer for quite some time but then circumstances changed and he received an offer to work on another company that couldn't refuse. So I didn't have any time to proper prepare for the role, well, I had a week, but the way I like to do things, that wasn't enough.

The consequences of that unfortunate circumstances let me without a proper knowledge transfer. That really marked my first two weeks where I had to catch on with everything my manager had on his plate, which was a lot. Lots of people were contacting me on Teams with the recurrent phrase: _I would normally ask that to your manager, but they tell me that I have to contact you instead..._

That was repeating every day: people that I don't know asking requests for projects I don't know about. That really stretched my skills of "learning as I go" which is very stressful as anyone can imagine.

### Not taking ownership of mistakes

I was surprised that my first reaction when something went south was looking for who was in charge of that. I don't use to blame anyone for mistakes but even with this mindset I was looking for the person responsible not specially to assign blame but for seek a solution. It is ok to look for a solution with the people involved on the problem but the ownership had to be mine and only mine.

If someone on the team fails, the whole team fails to deliver so I have failed leading the team: maybe I am not able to communicate properly the goals, provide the space needed for the job to be developed properly or a thousand other reasons.

### Assuming everyone has the same virtues and failures than myself

This is a tricky one and took me a lot to figure out. Actually, my wife said that to me when we were having a casual conversation about work: _maybe that does not comes natural to them as it comes natural to you_. That made something click inside my brain and made me start thinking about what it seems to be the virtues and failures of the members of my teams in comparison of my own virtues and failures.

The point is that when you do something really well, it is unnatural to you when others don't do it as well because you have it integrated on your being. Same thing with your failures... when you find something very difficult to do, you grant others the time and space to figure and work out that difficult task. And maybe that task is not as difficult as you think it is to others.

Reflecting of what it seemed to be the ups and downs of the team members (and actually asking them), helped me a lot to understand better the work distribution amongst them.

# List of corrections:

I could catch all of these mistakes (I believe), in time, and had the opportunity to establish proper corrections to mitigate its damage.

### Assuming ownership of all the mistakes

I have talked about ownership on other posts ({{< url-link "here" "http://www.joantolos.com/blog/extremeownership/" >}}, for example) and the first two weeks I failed to assume ownership of all the team work.

Ownership may be a burden but it has a golden benefit: if you own a problem, you can **do something** to tackle it. Maybe you can't solve it single handed but if you assume the responsibility, you can gather resources to work on it.

I started to assume every single failure of the team as my own. Then everything looked better almost immediately. I went from having individuals on the team that were failing randomly to have a proper team challenge in front of me.

### Creating clear goals and communicate them properly

I had a clearer vision about what the future will hold than before, when I was just coding. Due to having more meetings with product owner, technology director etc, I had more opportunities to run the priorities and goals on my head. I probably failed to share that vision with the team.

As a coder, when you know about the goals, priorities and overall business vision, you can deliver better results as you have some criteria to determine how to act when finding a stone on the road. These little decision as you are delivering your feature really sum up and at the end, you can benefit from it.

# Marketing and politics

I have discover that there is a certain degree of marketing in the sense of "selling" what the team does. I don't have special interest in that, but I understand now that it may be an important part of the job.

# Take overs

Some final lessons that I have integrated in my way of thinking after the whole experience.

### People, not resources

You are around people, working together to achieve a common goal. But that common goal is not the only thing that matters. People have needs, aspirations, personal goals and private problems that may not be align with the rest of the team. And rightfully so, of course.

As a leader, I understand I have to adapt to each team member circumstances and help them deliver the best they can. Maybe for someone that means help with priorities, some other person may benefit from actually suggesting what he or she should do today. Others prefer to work with a certain degree of liberty to really perform at their best. Other may want to be left alone completely... The job implies sometimes also understand that particular circumstances and juggle between each individual needs and the whole team needs.

If you think about it is a rather interesting and challenging job.

### I respect my team lead even more now

Now I truly understand his job and I am really thankful for all this time that I have been working with him. How he has been able to comply with all the requirements that I just mention and more.

He has a lot more experience than I have, of course, I was just trying for a while; but I realise now his level of expertise.

###  I can be a better programmer

For sure. Now I know what my manager exactly needs in the context of my team. It may be different on other teams or other companies, but I could "play for both teams" for a while and now I see what really adds value to the team.
