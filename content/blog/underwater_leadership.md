I don't usually do book reviews, I do put a little review on {{< url-link "GoodReads" "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126756201-joan" >}} now and then but it is not really my thing. {{< url-link "I did it before on this blog" "http://www.joantolos.com/blog/extremeownership/" >}} talking about the book {{< url-link "Extreme ownership" "https://amzn.to/2Rl15mS" >}}. I really like the military context when talking about leadership or how to manage a team because the stakes are so high. If I fail leading at my job, somebody loses money (maybe me), but if a military leader fails, people die.

For this post, I want to talk about another example of leadership on a military context. The book is: {{< url-link "Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders by Lieutenant David Marquet." "https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YM03EALB5N3J&dchild=1&keywords=turn+the+ship+around&qid=1615808636&sprefix=turn+the+ship%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-1" >}}

This is a case where two books together work better that each of them in isolation. I really think that if you like the topic (leadership in the military and how to transform those skills into civilian life), you should read both of them.

**Extreme Ownership** explains the situation of a guerrilla warfare in city location which is one of the most dangerous situations you can find, and **Turn the ship around** explains the situation of a nuclear submarine. Both cases are extremely dangerous for very different reasons, and that is why I believe that both of the books add something unique even when the leadership techniques are similar in some cases. Guerrilla warfare requires a fast adaptability to the terrain and the different circumstances, and also it is highly demanding from a physical point of view. On the other hand, when handling a nuclear submarine you deal with a very specific domain knowledge, a lot of protocols, safety issues and organisational hazards. Both cases deal with problems that, conceptually, you can face in any job that requires leadership.

# How the book is organised

{{< img-post path="/img/underwater/" file="book.png" alt="The actual book" type="center" >}}

The book establish three dimensions for leadership: **control, competence and clarity**. Each of them contains a list of actions to accomplish that goal. This sums up all of them:

**Control**
  * Find the genetic code for control and rewrite it.
  * Act your way to new thinking.
  * Short, early conversations make efficient work.
  * Use “I intend to . . .” to turn passive followers into active leaders.
  * Resist the urge to provide solutions.
  * Eliminate top-down monitoring systems.
  * Think out loud (both superiors and subordinates).
  * Embrace the inspectors.

**Competence**
  * Take deliberate action.
  * We learn (everywhere, all the time).
  * Don’t brief, certify.
  * Continually and consistently repeat the message.
  * Specify goals, not methods.

**Clarity**
  * Achieve excellence, don’t just avoid errors.
  * Build trust and take care of your people.
  * Use your legacy for inspiration.
  * Use guiding principles for decision criteria.
  * Use immediate recognition to reinforce desired behaviours.
  * Begin with the end in mind.
  * Encourage a questioning attitude over blind obedience.

Each of them is a chapter and it is finished with a list of "questions to consider" which are a series of open questions to reflect on the content of the chapter. The chapters are short and to the point and sometimes some of the concepts are repeated again and again throughout the whole book which can be a little annoying.

All of the concepts listed before, you can find on pretty much any book about leadership but the principles are sound, so it is always nice to read about them. Also, the background use case of the nuclear submarine is super entertaining (at least for me), and makes you the interest. It is also very engaging learning about the hierarchy on the US military and all the paperwork and bureaucracy overhead that it is involved in pretty much any decision.

# My take outs for my day to day job

Very early on the book, the author provides a very specific list of questions to ask to the members of the team that you are supposed to lead when arriving in a new team:

* What are the things you are hoping I don’t change?
* What are the things you secretly hope I do change?
* What are the good things about the ship we should build on?
* If you were me what would you do first?
* Why isn’t the ship doing better?
* What are your personal goals for your tour here on the ship?
* What impediments do you have to doing your job?
* What will be our biggest challenge to getting the ship ready for deployment?
* What are your biggest frustrations about how the ship is currently run?
* What is the best thing I can do for you?

I find these questions very appropriate because they leave room for the members of the team to shape how they want to be lead. If you are a good leader, you should listen and adapt your style to the needs or the team instead of forcing a establish agenda that you may have. You should also have the knowledge to be able to adapt so you should learn different styles and techniques to you can apply the proper one from the insight gathered from those questions.

I believe the question list is solid. You may not want to make it formal, having a one to one interview with each team member and check all the boxes, but maybe introducing the questions as a conversation from time to time, may be a good approach.

# Acting your way to excellence

There is another technique that I liked a lot which is _act your way to new thinking_. In a nutshell, it means to act out what it is supposed to be the ideal final state of the organisation or the team. Asking questions like, "how our team would look like if everything was perfect?" Figure out that ideal and then just act out in consequence.

Making a simile with my workplace. For example, I would like to publish our code as open source for other companies to enjoy and to improve. Well, if that was the case, what should we change? Maybe we need to pay more attention to pull requests. Maybe we have to allocate more time to code reviews, whatever... Well, start doing all those things. Acting out as you already have accomplished the goal is going to put you closer to it. We are what we constantly do, we are habit machines. Building the right habit can get you the right goal.

# Domain specific details matter, a lot

The book tells a very nice example of how a minor detail specific to your domain can make a very big difference on the output. For that case, inside the submarine, the don't _**Close the valves**_, they _**Shut the valves**_. Why? Because the word _close_ can be confused with the word _blow_. The word _shut_ does not leave any room for interpretation or confusion.

This is not going to happen in my domain, I mean, it is not that dramatically important to take care of any single word when communicating. Blowing a valve can be a matter of life and death on a nuclear submarine but may not have any significant impact on some other domains. The take over here is... look for your very specific domain details because even the minor thing that you think is not THAT important, can have a huge impact at the end. The crew of the submarine were refining their communication iterating again and again to remove any confusion and chance of mistake possible, to the point of having a guideline about how you are suppose to communicate the close a valve. What specific word you should use. That level of detail matters.

Find the level of detail that is relevant on your job, on your team and tackle it. Every minor improvement for minuscule that can be, it is a step forward to excellence.

# Avoiding mistakes and culture of fear

There was a moment on the submarine where everyone was more focused on not doing any more mistakes than actually doing a good job. The reputation was so bad that the crew didn't want to risk it anymore.

When you reach that point you enter into "survival mode", and this is a mode that is fairly usual on the workplace. People are afraid of making mistakes and practically paralysed by fear. Of course, the best way not to make a mistake is not to do anything or make any decisions.

# Take over

These are just examples of insight I gathered from the book. Overall is a very nice read. Again, the use case of the submarine it is very entertaining and I have enjoyed a lot learning about specifics of such complicated machine.

If you like these kinds of books, you will enjoy it.
