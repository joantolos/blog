I was talking with an ex peer some time ago. We were talking about taking new chances and moving on from one job to another. I told him that sometimes I feel like I am asking too much and I have doubts of my potential. Then he told me that this is called **the imposter syndrome** and that it happens to him as well. That was the first time I heard the expression, then I started to take a look and research a little bit.

Wikipedia define the term as _a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalised fear of being exposed as a "fraud". Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do **not deserve all they have achieved.** Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to **luck**, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be._

There are a couple of concepts there that I found interesting.

## Luck

This I recognise on myself sometimes: a particularly big accomplishment matching with a series of coincidences that one can consider luck. Well, yes, sometimes looks like all the pieces fall into their place by some wonders of magic, but do they really?.. On second thought, if I really pay attention I discover that this proper conditions are created by hard and constant good work. I don't want to say "create you own luck" because it sounds like some cheap quote from a self help book.

What I would say is that hard work, showing up and keep trying no matter what, will create an environment around your work that will propitiate this proper conditions when needed.

And that is on you. Not on luck or some mystical karmic universal force that keep things "even" or "fair". The universe does not care about you, at all. It is simpler than that.

If you do a good job, people will appreciate it. Then they will be willing to help you the next time which will make you do a good job again. In doing so, you gain more and more expertise which will perfect your craft and that will create the illusion of luck, like everything goes well. But it is not luck, is simply hard work. I know... is not a sexy idea, in fact, is kind of boring if we compare it with the mystic gods taking care of us. But most of the times, the simple explanation is the correct one.

## Not deserving what we achieve

Sometimes we attribute the success to the help of others more than in our own work. It is obvious that any big project needs the help of other people in order to succeed but this does not mean that your contribution is worthless.

It is easier for us to identify excellency in others rather than yourself. The thought pattern is... _"I did this and it is all right but this guy... that is really awesome"_

This was precisely represented with this illustration that {{< url-link "@earth_kate" "https://twitter.com/Earth_Kate" >}} posted on twitter:

We all have a fair amount of expertise in some topics. We don't know it all of course, others know more than us in some areas. Those areas overlap with your knowledge and you feel overwhelm because anyone seems to know more than you. But this is only the fantasy of the overlapping. If you look at the picture on the right, the blue circle is as big as all the other yellow ones. So you know as much as the next person, just not the same.

## What can we do about it

At this point, you already start to see that this feelings does not correspond with reality most of the time. You probably feel sympathetic as you have experience them at some point in time. So the first and most effective way to get rid of the problem is talk / read about it. Acknowledge the problem, naming it and seeing that you are not alone, are the first steps.

This wonderful short video sum up possible solutions:

* **Talk about it**

    When you express this feeling out loud, others will correct you. Telling you that in fact, you are contributing a lot and it is only a feeling not necessarily matching reality. Also they will tell you that they feel the same way, often about the same topic!

    For example, you finish a project involving you and another person. At the end you expose your feeling that the other person contributed more and the success of the project is extremely related to the other person expertise and well doing. Most of the cases the other person will say the same thing about you so... which one is true? Can't be both true at the same time.

    The reality lies between the two extremes.

* **Recognise accomplishments**

    It is well proven than positive reinforcement is far more successful than negative reinforcement. Say you are training a dog... you will have more success if you reward the dog with treats when it does something good than if you punish it when does something bad. In fact, the punishment is carved into the brain deeper than the reward so you will have to apply **ten times** positive reinforcement in other to erase the effects of **one** negative reinforcement.

    This is why is so awful saying things like _"I don't love you, you are dumb, etc"_ to kids, because it will take ten positive assertions to erase the effects of just one of the negative. This makes the child fearful, sad, frustrated and angry.

    The point is, we are always in need of positive reinforcement so it is important that you identify the milestones. The little victories leading to the success. Take some time to reflect about all the things you do, how they affect and help others and you will be surprise of the results. Keep reminding yourself that and do some meta learning when finishing a project.

* **Psychological needs are as important as physical needs: The sense of mastery**

    We are pretty much aware of the physical needs and it's importance. If I prevent you from shelter, food or water, things will go south for you really, **really** quick. Psychological needs are no different. There are several things that we need or our wellbeing decreases rapidly. Feeling of accomplishment, belonging to a group are examples but the one related with this post topic is: **the sense of mastery.**

    This concept can be defined as _the extent to which we think we have control over the forces that govern our lives, and how much we trust that our actions can influence the outcomes of various situations._

    This is a basic psychological need that human beings have. If we think that we don't have control over our life and we are not able to correlate our actions with the outcome, we will feel powerless and helpless leading to anxiety and depression very quick.

    Looking it from another side, when we achieve something important or great, we can not attribute it to luck or the help of others. Your actions lead to this good outcome. Since you master your life, that is the only possible conclusion.
