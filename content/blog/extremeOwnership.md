The premise of this book is very interesting. The authors are two former Navy SEALs:

_The navy SEALs are the U.S. Navy's primary special operations force and a component of the Naval Special Warfare Command. Among the SEALs' main functions are conducting small-unit maritime military operations that originate from, and return to, a river, ocean, swamp, delta, or coastline. The SEALs are trained to operate in all environments (sea, air, and land) for which they are named. (Extracted from Wikipedia)_

These are badass men that conduct the most hard training ever invented and immerse themselves on extremely dangerous situations. So, what am I doing reading a book from these guys? Because they have written a book about leadership.

When I fail on my work, somebody loses money. When they fail, people die; so I really want to learn about how they lead their men to a successful mission.

They have created this company {{< url-link "Echelon Front" "https://www.echelonfront.com" >}} where they offer a series of services, solutions and trainings about leadership. If you want to have a little taste, the TED talk by Jocko is a good place to start:

## How the book is organised

The authors pick a theme involving leadership dilemmas. First explain a real battlefield situation where they faced that problem. Then extract the principle, main concept or lessons learn from that experience and at the end they describe an application of that knowledge on a real business situation.

## The concept

**Extreme Ownership** is the most important concept of this book, and it threads across the other lessons. It is a concept that we should apply to the business world. You canâ€™t blame your products, your boss, your budget, the economy, competitors or your team for your success or failure. You are accountable for your success in your job, your career and your life.

A true leader owns the outcome. When things go wrong, you have to take ownership. No excuses.

I wrote about this concept from the point of view of complaining on the work place on the post _{{< url-link "Why do you hate your work" "http://www.joantolos.com/blog/hatejob/" >}}_ where I argument that you and only you own your career without excuses or blaming others.

## Some example

I won't make a full summary of the book or an extract of all the principles explained. No summary will substitute the experience of read the actual book. I rater explain a few examples to better understand how the book is crafted so you can decide if it is interesting to you.

### No bad teams, only bad leaders

The combat example is very interesting in this case, it's about the hard training that SEALs take. In one of the training exercise, the students (grouped by teams) had to perform a series of races carrying heavy boats around, following specific instructions of what to do with them. For example, carry the boat to the beach, put it into the water, jump in it, then turn it around, jump off again, carry the boat again to the land (this is over simplified).

The goal of the exercise is not only to stress the physical condition of the students (this kind of exercises go on for a full week on which is know as "Hell Week"), but to train them into follow specific complicated instructions when physically exhausted and fully immerse into hard conditions. Each team had a student team leader assigned which receive the instructions from the teacher and then communicate them to the team in what he considered the most appropriate matter to win the race. So, the team leader had to lead the team to the win.

After several races, one of the teams performed very well winning all the races, and other team was finishing last every single time. The instructors decided to just switch the leaders of the team and (you guest it right), the "bad team" with the good leader won the next race.

The principle is obviously, that there is no bad team, only bad leader. The business application example explains how a CTO reticent to accept the concept of extreme ownership was removed from the position and the team achieved great success with another person leading it. This example is particularly interesting because of how the CTO refuses to accept advise and help from others again and again.

## Some critique

I found the book a little bit condescending at times. Also, most situations and examples look over simplified and some quoted conversations look like scripts. I think this is just to be on point and better deliver the concept but still, I think there is room to improve there.
Some ideas are repeated over and over during the whole book.

In general, I think there is a good message here and it is a book worth reading; but maybe it can be better summarised and straight to the point.
