Extract

# The typical real-life ETL cycle steps:

* Starting point
* Build reference data. Reference data is data used to classify or categorise other data. Typically, they are static or slowly changing over time.
* Extract from sources
* Apply the validation rules and constraints, making sure the data is ready and correct.
* Transform: clean, apply business rules, check for data integrity, create aggregates, etc...
* Stage: load into staging tables or data structures if needed
* Testing and reporting. Checking the business rules once the data is there, sending reports with statistics etc...
* Publish to final data structure
* Historical storage and archive
