I've been writing about my work, technology and the life as a software development for quite a few years. Now I want to include you in the conversation.

In my _Nada nuevo bajo el sol_ podcast, I will talk about my day to day as a developer. I will attend your questions and comments and address them on the air.

You can submit your questions on the contact form of this very web or sending an email at: info@joantolos.com

For over a decade I’ve been writing about work, technology and the deep life in my bestselling books and national publications such as the New Yorker and New York Times. Now it’s your turn to drive the conversation!

These are the latest ten episodes of the podcast. Don't forget to subscribe on the channel of your choice if you want to keep track.
