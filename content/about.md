I define myself as father, husband, coder and guitar fool. In that order.

I enjoy every day the overwhelming energy and will of my son and daughter. I am passionate about coding, I like to read, share with others, learn and try new things whenever I have the chance. As a software developer I believe in:

* Responsibility
* Not hiding things under the rug
* Exposing what is wrong instead of complaining
* Pursuing excellence

I play guitar and I make music on my spare time. Because is fulfilling, increases creativity and it's fun.

This blog intends to compile my thoughts as I learn and discover new things. I share interesting articles, write some of my own and give back to the software community. If someone can benefit from something written here, the job is well done.

Contact me on the social networks that I am using if you like, I will be happy to answer.

Thanks for reading!
