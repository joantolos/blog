I'm a software developer based on Barcelona. I enjoy every day the overwhelming energy and will of my son and daughter. I am passionate about coding and reading. I like to share with others, learn and try new things whenever I have the chance. As a software developer I believe in:

* Responsibility and accountability
* Not hiding things under the rug
* Proposing improvements and solutions instead of complaining
* Pursuing excellence

I deliver. I may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end, I know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.

This blog intends to compile my thoughts as I learn and discover new things. I share interesting articles, write some of my own and give back to the software community.

Contact me if you like and I will be happy to answer.

Thanks for reading!
