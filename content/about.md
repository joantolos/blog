I define myself as father, husband, coder and guitar fool. In that order.

I enjoy every day the overwhelming energy and will of my son Adria. I am passionate about coding, I like to read, share with others, learn and try need things whenever I have the chance. As software developer I believe in:

* **Responsibility**
* **Not hiding** things under the rug
* **Exposing** what is wrong instead of **complaining**
* Pursue **excellence**

I play guitar and I make music on my spare time. Because is fulfilling, increases creativity and it's fun. 

This site intends to compile my thoughts as I learn and discover new things. I share interesting articles, write some of my own and give back to the software community. If someone can benefit from something written here, the job is well done. 

Thanks for reading!
