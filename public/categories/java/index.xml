      <title>Fixing date on exported videos from Apple&#39;s Photos</title>

      <description>I have been dealing with an annoying problem when using the app Photos on Mac OS.
I sort my photos and videos by years and Photos has a nice feature to create &amp;ldquo;smart albums&amp;rdquo; where you can sort the content by different criteria like &amp;ldquo;file name contains&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and things like that. At the end of the year, I make an export of all the content for the last year and store it as an archive in a remote hard drive in case Photos stops working, or I have to reset the computer or something, so I don&amp;rsquo;t loose the photos and videos.</description>

      <title>Java, Spring and Hibernate microservice seed</title>

      <description>I am frequently doing posts about TDD and trying to facilitate code seeds with everything in place to work with TDD, for example here or here .
This time I want to provide a step by step guide for a microservice that will work with Java, Spring, Hibernate and Postgres that will be TDD ready from localhost all the way up to production. The challenge here, is to set up a comfortable way to test when dealing with a database and Spring.</description>

      <title>Dealing with JSON in Java</title>

      <description>I have been working with Javascript for a while (TypeScript actually) and one of the features that I found interesting is the way you can deal with JSON with javascript. Create, modify and manipulate a JSON object with javascript is very easy and intuitive. It actually allows you to do whatever you want so you may break the JSON if you are not careful.
Trying to do this kind of manipulations with Java is possible, but does not come out of the box and some libraries will be needed.</description>

      <description>Our community manager needs a software to generate a single text sentence containing all the desired hashtags. The main feature is that it has to be quick and easy to use. Just copy from the software and paste into the social media post.
Requirements Given a static finite list of words, we want a single string containing a random sub set of said words, separated by spaces and preceded with the character #.</description>

      <title>6 tools to help you do TDD with Java and Spring Cloud</title>

      <description>I am always trying to manifest the benefits of TDD (see: The real reason why you don&amp;#39;t like TDD and TDD: All in ). Most of the times when I find colleges that “can’t” do it right away it is because their software is not “TDD ready” meaning that it is difficult to test. Solving that pitfall alone is going to improve your software because good code is easy to test, generally speaking.</description>

      <description>The conference This conference has been growing year by year and now is one of the referents. I have been lucky enough to be able to attend to all the editions until now.
The JBCNConf is a meeting point for programmers, developers and development professionals, who meet to do networking and learn about the Java world and its latest developments.
The event is organised by Barcelona JUG (Barcelona Java Users Group) , a non-profit association made up of programmers, engineers and other technology lovers.</description>

      <title>Merging two objects in Java</title>

      <description>I am working with a micro-service which relays a lot on configuration. This configuration is defined on JSON files that business people can edit in order to change the service behaviour. For example, enable or disable features, define default values, etc&amp;hellip; The service includes a mechanism that allows to update this configuration files on real time as soon as the file is updated (using the Netflix API: Archaius )
The business people can mess around with the behaviour of the service just editing JSON files.</description>

      <description>I attended the Java Barcelona Conference again for the forth time now and I want to share some of my experiences.
About the Conference The JBCNConf is a meeting point for programmers, developers and development professionals, who meet to do networking and learn about the Java world and its latest developments. Among the Java experts who will speak at the conferences are figures from the universe of programming such as Simon Maple, Marcus Biel and Rustam Mehmandarov.</description>

      <title>Code coverage as a tool</title>
      <link>http://www.joantolos.com/blog/katamarsrover/</link>

      <description>I want to explain how I use the code coverage as a tool when I code. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care for the final number of test coverage, if you code using TDD this number will be very high anyway. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that we can trust the quality of our code by some test coverage percentage, we all know that figures can be easily hacked, so there is no point on taking much attention at the final count.</description>

      <description>For those not familiar with the concept of kata in programming, I can not make a better definition that the one on Code Kata:   A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long). Some involve programming, and can be coded in many different ways.</description>
