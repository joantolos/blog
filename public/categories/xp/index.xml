      <description>I have been revisiting the classic by Kent Beck, “Extreme Programming Explained”, and I found a very interesting thought about one of the roles on the XP team: architects.
Communicating architectural intent According to his definition:
[…] architects on and XP team look for and execute large-scale refactoring, write system-level tests that stress the architecture, and also implement stories. […]
What I find interesting about that, is the system level tests as they can communicate architectural intent.</description>
