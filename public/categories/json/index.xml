      <description>I have been working with Javascript for a while (TypeScript actually) and one of the features that I found interesting is the way you can deal with JSON with javascript. Create, modify and manipulate a JSON object with javascript is very easy and intuitive. It actually allows you to do whatever you want so you may break the JSON if you are not careful.
Trying to do this kind of manipulations with Java is possible, but does not come out of the box and some libraries will be needed.</description>
