      <description>As the world is facing the pandemic caused by this new Coronavirus strain, most of my colleagues and myself are forced to work from home. I want to share my experience working without leaving the house.
Particular circumstances I want to point out that this is not just &amp;ldquo;working from home&amp;rdquo;, these are extreme circumstances.
In my case, the most defining one is the fact that the schools are closed. That means that my two kids (which are four and two) have to be with my wife and myself at home and due to their ages, we can not leave them alone.</description>

      <description>I had the opportunity of take over my manager role for a brief period of time due to his parenting absence. I was doing it kind of informally when he was on vacation or had a sick day or something. This time it was for a longer and delimited period so we kind of &amp;ldquo;formalised&amp;rdquo; the whole thing.
I have to say, this time, I was really happy coding and had a very nice plan for the year (this role change was happening on January) and I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the new responsibility with a lot of enthusiasm.</description>
