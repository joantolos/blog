      <description>Introducing katas  For those not familiar with the concept of kata in programming, I can not make a better definition that the one on Code Kata:   A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long). Some involve programming, and can be coded in many different ways.</description>

We had to implement the new feature using the green boxes.</description>
