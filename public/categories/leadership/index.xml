      <description>I had the opportunity of take over my manager role for a brief period of time due to his parenting absence. I was doing it kind of informally when he was on vacation or had a sick day or something. This time it was for a longer and delimited period so we kind of &amp;ldquo;formalised&amp;rdquo; the whole thing.
I have to say, this time, I was really happy coding and had a very nice plan for the year (this role change was happening on January) and I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the new responsibility with a lot of enthusiasm.</description>

      <description>Extreme leadership is a book by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin about how U.S. Navy SEALs lead and win.
The premise of this book is very interesting. The authors are two former Navy SEALs:
The navy SEALs are the U.S. Navy&amp;rsquo;s primary special operations force and a component of the Naval Special Warfare Command. Among the SEALs&amp;rsquo; main functions are conducting small-unit maritime military operations that originate from, and return to, a river, ocean, swamp, delta, or coastline.</description>
