      <description>The conference This conference has been growing year by year and now is one of the referents. I have been lucky enough to be able to attend to all the editions until now.
The JBCNConf is a meeting point for programmers, developers and development professionals, who meet to do networking and learn about the Java world and its latest developments.
The event is organised by Barcelona JUG (Barcelona Java Users Group) , a non-profit association made up of programmers, engineers and other technology lovers.</description>
