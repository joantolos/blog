      <description>A few days ago, I was struggling at work with a simple implementation of sorting a couple of arrays. I was coding it in a language that I am not so good at: Javascript. I asked for help to one of my peers, we shared the pain for a little while and finally we got it.
Since it was such a simple &amp;ldquo;exercise looking&amp;rdquo; problem, I remember saying: this looks like the typical exercise they ask you to solve on an interview, and both of us struggled for a while with such a simple problem.</description>
