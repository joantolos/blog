      <description>Some thoughts about the amount of code you write that never see production and how to take it.
The context We were asked to implement a new feature, let&amp;rsquo;s say, selling apples. Not groceries, not fruits, just apples. Well, maybe on the next Sprint we will add bananas to sell as well. But that&amp;rsquo;s it, apples now and bananas later.
We all love to code for lists instead of instances, so the coder assigned to the task designed a beautiful code supporting a whole list of fruits, even it was clear from the start that business just needed apples for now.</description>
